<h2>PRESENTATION</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mother Nature</span> is every bit as fond of the little folks
in her human family as of the grown-ups, and while she
prepares untold joys for lovers of the outdoors among men
and women and larger boys and girls, she never forgets
the little ones.</p>

<p>For their benefit she keeps an open toy-shop full of marvellous
playthings, all free to any child who wants them,
and instead of the children paying her for what they take
she pays them for coming to her by giving them rosier
cheeks, brighter eyes, and stronger bodies. She puts more
glee into their laughter and greater happiness into their
trustful little hearts.</p>

<p>As in the large department stores in big cities, the goods
in Mother Nature's shop are changed for each season of
the year; so the little shoppers have constant variety and
hail every new season with fresh delight. This book is
written to call attention to the beautiful and wonderful
things to be found in Mother Nature's toy-shop and to
tell what to do with them, for one must know how to use
the amusing material that is furnished.</p>

<p>After really getting into this most enchanting of all toy-shops
with eyes open to see its wonders, we found that the
difficulty to be met was not how to write about them, but
how to stop writing. The display was so varied and so
inviting, it seemed that we must tell the children about
everything we saw, but if we had gone on seeing more and
telling more there is no saying what size this book would
have been.</p>

<h3>What You Can Do with Them</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Wild</span> flowers, like children, are up early. <i>They</i> don't
want to lie abed after their long winter's sleep; they want
to be awake and see what is going on in the world. While
you think it is still winter there is a stirring going on
under the blankets of brown earth, and sometimes before
the snow is off the ground you may find the little things
working up through the stiff soil and opening their eyes
to the gentle spring sunshine.</p>

<p>It is remarkable the way the soft, tender sprouts force
their way through hard ground that we would have to
take a knife or trowel to dig into. But they do it. Not
all at once with a great, blustering rush, but gently, steadily,
and quietly they push and keep on pushing until
their heads are above ground; then they begin to grow in
good earnest, and pretty soon they laugh right out into
blossom.</p>

<p>The pleasure these earliest wild flowers give us is in
going out to look for them and in gathering handfuls to
carry home and put into little glass bowls to be "Oh'd"
over and wondered at, to be admired and loved because
they are lovely, and because they bring some of the sweet
outdoors of spring into the furnace-heated house.</p>

<p>They are too delicate and fragile, these anemones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
hepaticas, and bloodroots, to be handled and played
with, but later come the stronger, sturdier flowers and with
many of these you can do all sorts of entertaining things.
You don't have to look very far for them either. They
are in the fields, by the roadsides, and even along the edges
of the streets of a village or small town. You won't find
them in the city.</p>

<p>To begin with, there are the daisies. How white the
fields are with them! If they are fine, large daisies on
tall, strong stems they will reach up to your waist&mdash;that
is, if you are a little girl. If you are bigger they will come
well above your knees. There are a number of things
that you can do with them. First, you can make a really
beautiful</p>


<h3>Daisy Crown</h3>

<div class="caption">Fig.2 - Turn the stem of B under
the stem of A</div>
</div>

<p>Gather a whole lot of daisies with rather long stems.
They will stay fresh longer if you put them into a pail of
cool water and let them drink a little before using them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and if they have wilted while you carried them, the water
will bring them up again as fresh as&mdash;why, as fresh as a
daisy to be sure. This
is the way to make the
crown. It is a new
way and a good way.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 369px;"><a id="Fig_3"></a>
<img src="images/i_013a.png" width="369" height="166" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig.3 - Bring B around and in front
of it's own upright.</div>
</div>

<p>Take one daisy in
your left hand and
hold it, not upright
but in what is called
a horizontal position
like the one marked A in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>, then with your right
hand hold another daisy upright and place its stem in
front of and across
the stem of the first,
as you see it in <a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 380px;"><a id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i_013b.png" width="380" height="170" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig.4 - Let the stem of B rest on
the stem of A</div>
</div>

<p>This second daisy
we will call B. Now
turn the stem of B
under the stem of A
and up at the back as
it is in <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2</a>. Bring
this same stem, B,
around and in
front of its own
upright part like
<a href="#Fig_3">Fig. 3</a>. Turn it
all the way around
the upright part
and let the stem of
B rest on top of
the stem of A. <a href="#Fig_4">Fig. 4</a> shows this, but in the drawing the
stems are separated a little so that you may see each one
plainly. It is something like weaving, you see. And it
is weaving of a sort.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 411px;"><a id="Fig_5"></a>
<img src="images/i_013c.png" width="411" height="165" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig.5 - Weave another daisy, C, on
the first two stems.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>Across the stems of the daisies A and B, two stems
this time, place the stem of another daisy that we will
call C, and weave it on the first two stems exactly as you
wove B onto A (<a href="#Fig_5">Fig. 5</a>). The stem of the fourth daisy
will have to cross three stems, A, B, and C. The fifth
daisy-stem will cross four stems, but after that the end
of the daisy-stem A will probably have been passed and
you will be weaving on the others. It depends upon the
length of the stems how many are woven over; sometimes
there may be five. It is not well to have more than that
number. You can cut a stem off when it seems to be going
too far around the crown.</p>

<img src="images/i_014.png" width="464" height="291" alt="wreath" />
<div class="caption">Fig.6 - A new way to make a Daisy Wreath.</div>
</div>

<p>Place the daisies close enough together to have their
petals touch, or even crowd a trifle, because when the
crown is curved and the ends brought together the flowers
will separate and leave wider spaces. When you have
woven enough daisies to make your crown the proper size
to fit your head, cut the last stems off about two inches
from the last flower and, with a strong blade of grass or
piece of string, tie them to the stem of the daisy A, just
back of the flower. <a href="#Fig_6">Fig. 6</a> shows what the daisy crown
looks like when finished.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>JACK-IN-THE-PULPIT</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the earliest wild flowers to show its head above
ground is Jack-in-the-pulpit. It is an odd plant and what
we call the flower is not the blossom at all, but a protecting
leaf called a spathe which surrounds the tiny flowers
growing on the club-shaped spike (or spadix) standing upright
inside.</p>

<p>That is a good thing to know and remember, but what
concerns us now is that there is a pulpit with its curved
sounding-board&mdash;or perhaps it is a striped awning&mdash;overhead,
and that in the pulpit is Jack.</p>

<p>He is a cheerful little preacher and his pulpit is somewhat
gayer than we usually see, but no one ever told Jack
that to be good he must be solemn and that to preach he
must have a pulpit rich and sombre. The good God who
made him gave him his pretty, striped pulpit with its
striped awning to shelter it, and Jack goes on preaching
his cheerful sermons from this as long as he lives. Hear
what some one has said of him:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Jack-in-the-Pulpit preaches to-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Under the green trees, just over the way;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Squirrel and Song-Sparrow high on their perch,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hear the sweet lily-bells ringing to church.</span><br />
<br />
"Come, hear what his reverence rises to say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">In his low, painted pulpit, this calm Sabbath day.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fair is the canopy over him seen</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Pencilled by Nature's hand, black, brown, and green."</span><br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 302px;"><a id="Fig_7"></a>
<img src="images/i_016.png" width="302" height="555" alt="diagram" />
<div class="caption">Fig.7 - Cut a hole at the back
of the Pulpit.</div>
</div>
<p>Some people who love the woods and the wild flowers
can understand Jack's wild-wood language. They will
tell you that over and over again he is saying: "Come into
the clean, shady woods and learn to love all the wonderful
living, growing things to be found here. Come into the
green woods and hear what we
can tell you of beauty and
love and kindness; of courage
and perseverance and strength,
for plants must have courage
and perseverance as well as
strength in order to live."</p>

<p>All the time these plants are
working in the ground and
above it to make their flowers
perfect and their seeds fruitful.
Sometimes it is difficult work,
too, if the soil does not give
them enough food, or a dry
summer chokes them with
thirst. Sometimes they must
struggle hard to gain a footing
between the rocks where they
were told to grow, or to keep
from being crowded out by
stronger, coarser plants that
are called weeds.</p>

<p>But they keep on trying to
do their part and to do it
well; they work and love, and their children, the blossoms,
laugh, laugh, laugh with the happiness of it all.</p>

<p>Now if Jack seems to you to stand too still in his pulpit
while he preaches all this, why you can make him
move around. He can turn first to one side then to the
other, and he can lean forward over the front with extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
arms as some preachers do when they are very
much in earnest.</p>

<p>For this you will first have to cut a hole at the back of
the pulpit near the bottom, as is shown
in <a href="#Fig_7">Fig. 7</a>, then, slipping your knife inside,
cut Jack loose from the flower and drop
him out from the top by turning the
pulpit upside down.</p>

<p>Cut off the lower, thin part of the
spike to which the arrow points in <a href="#Fig_8">Fig. 8</a>
and, after puncturing a deep hole in the
end, push in a very slender twig or grass-stem.
<a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a> shows how this is done.
For arms that will make Jack seem more
like a little man, push a short piece of
grass-stem through the spike near the
top where you see it in <a href="#Fig_9">Fig. 9</a>. Make
a hole all the way through the spike
with a pin so that the arms will slip
in easily.</p>

<p>When you are ready for Jack to
preach put him in his pulpit, sliding
the grass-stem through the hole at
the back. While you hold the stem
of the pulpit in one hand take the
grass-stem in the other and, by moving
it up and down, twisting it one
way, then the other, and tipping it
up, you can make him rise up tall
and straight, then sink down; you
can make him turn to the right and
to the left and lean forward. That
is being active enough in such a
small pulpit, isn't it?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>RED AND WHITE CLOVERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the roadside, through the meadows, on the farm, at
the cottage door, and in your own yard those dear, familiar
little friends, the clover-blossoms, come to greet you.
Even in city parks you may find them, and always they
are ready and glad to help you have a good time. Gather
a lot of these flowers and sit in the shade under a tree
with your lap filled with them while I tell you how to
make a</p>


<h3>Clover Wreath</h3>

<p>Select some long-stemmed blossoms and leaves, bunch
them and bind their stems together their full length with
strong grass or string. Wind the grass around and around
the stems, tucking the ends securely in under the last
wind. You may need several long blades of grass for
binding one bunch.</p>

<p>In the same way make a second bunch and fit the flowers
up close against the first bunch of blossoms, with their
stems lying along the side of the first stems. Do not lap
the flowers of one bunch over the flowers of another.
Fasten the second bunch in place by binding the stems to
those of the first bunch; then make a third bunch and bind
it on next to the second bunch. Continue making these
clover bunches and binding their stems to the stems of
those already a part of the wreath until the strip is long
enough to fit around your head. Try it on and, if it is
the proper length, join the two ends by binding the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
stems to the stems of the first bunches. <a href="#Fig_10">Fig. 10</a> shows the
clover wreath complete.</p>

<p>You should also have a</p>


<h3>Clover Bracelet</h3>

<div class='unindent'>to wear with the wreath. Make this as you did the
wreath but with much smaller bunches. Keep binding
the bunches together until the strip for the bracelet fits
your arm (<a href="#Fig_11">Fig. 11</a>), then join the two ends, and slip the
pretty thing on your wrist. Of course, you will want</div>


<h3>Clover Earrings</h3>

<div class='unindent'>to match, and those two plump, full, fresh blossoms lying
at the top of the others on your lap are exactly what you
need.</div>

<p>Take one of these clovers and fit it in tight between
your cheek and the lobe of your ear (<a href="#Fig_12">Fig. 12</a>). Be careful
not to break the long stem, for you must bring it up snugly
just back of your ear along the line where the ear joins
your head, and when this is done, bend the end of the stem
down gently over the top of your ear. The stem will hold
your earring in place. Make the other earring in the same
way. The two clover-blossoms used for the earrings should
be as much alike as possible both in size and shape. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
should be matched carefully, as pearls and diamonds are
matched in a pair of real earrings.</p>

<p>Now for a "solitaire"</p>


<h3>Clover Ring</h3>

<div class='unindent'>Choose the finest clover for the jewel, and hold it against
the back of your left forefinger while you wrap the stem
once around the finger, loop it over the blossom and draw
the loop tight. Fasten the end by tucking it under and
over, and again under the stem ring on your finger. This
clover ring is really very effective, and can be made of any
colored clover. <a href="#Fig_13">Fig. 13</a> gives an idea of how it looks.</div>


<h3>A Necklace of Clover</h3>

<div class='unindent'>will complete your beautiful set of flower jewelry. Make
the necklace as you made the bracelet and fasten three
pendant blossoms at the centre, allowing the middle clover
to hang down a little below those on either side (<a href="#Fig_14">Fig. 14</a>).</div>

<p>Now you are ready, with the addition of a long, straight
twig, at the top of which you have fastened a bouquet of
clover, to play that you are queen of all the clover fairies,
and that your clover-tipped twig is your magic wand.</p>


<h3>Other Things of Clover</h3>

<p>The running, vinelike clovers are fine to use for climbing-roses
on outdoor doll-houses. They can also be trained
over the doll garden-frames and arches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>CLOVER DESIGNS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever admired the pretty patterns on wallpaper
of flowers and green leaves? Have you ever embroidered
dainty designs in colors on white linen, and do
you love it all? If you do, you will like to make some designs
yourself in a new way, and with real flowers and real
leaves.</p>

<p>You don't have to know how to draw or to paint
in this designing, for the flowers are there ready for you
to use, more exquisitely drawn and colored than the
greatest artist could do them. Your part is to group and
arrange them on a sheet of paper so that they will form
beautiful designs; designs that will not only delight you,
but that may be copied in embroidery or in other ways.</p>

<p>Merely to place the flowers on the paper in some sort
of a pattern is interesting, but the design won't last because
the flowers won't stay in place. Your sleeve may
wipe them all off, or a puff of air blow them away, so a
method has been invented especially for you that will keep
them where you want them to stay, and that method is
simply to <i>paste</i> them there.</p>

<p>You can make designs of almost any kind of flowers,
the common pink-and-white clover that grows underfoot
nearly everywhere makes a particularly pretty one. This
is the long-stemmed, viny kind, and its name is alsike
clover. <a href="#Fig_15">Fig. 15</a> shows what the alsike clover looks like,
and you will see that its leaves are rather pointed at the
tip, and shaped more like the leaves of the large red clover
than like the almost round ones of the little white clover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

</div>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The graceful, upright design (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>) was made of the
alsike clover, the blossom of which was a deep-rose color,
and the original design when finished looked like a piece
of embroidery done in silks. It was so lovely I wish that
it could be given in its natural colors here.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 617px;"><a id="Fig_17"></a>
<img src="images/i_024.png" width="617" height="386" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.17 - Parts of upright Clover design.</div>
</div>

<p>Look at <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a> carefully and see that while the sprays
of clover at the right and left appear to be exactly alike,
though turned in opposite directions, they are not really
so, and the little differences help to make the design interesting.
They keep it from being what we call monotonous.
Now look at D, E, and F, <a href="#Fig_17">Fig. 17</a>. These are tracings
of the sprays of clover before they were grouped
together to form the design <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. The spray on the left,
marked D, is just as it grew and as it was used in the
finished design; but F, on the right, had to have the little
budded spray added at the place on the stem shown by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the arrows to make it resemble and balance the other.
This bud with its leaves was clipped from another clover-vine.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 595px;">

<img src="images/i_025a.png" width="595" height="228" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.18 - Running design of Clover.</div>
</div>

<p>The spray in the centre of the design was like E, <a href="#Fig_17">Fig.
17</a>, and it was necessary to give it the extra leaves shown at
its right because, without them, it was not symmetrical,
which means evenly balanced, and it would not have
looked well in the design.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 555px;"><a id="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i_025b.png" width="555" height="274" alt="outline drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig.19 - Parts of running design.</div>
</div>

<p>When all of the material was collected and ready to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
put together, the central spray, E, was laid in the middle
of a sheet of unruled, white paper with the lower end of
the stem near the bottom edge, then the sprays D and F
were placed on the right and left of the centre one and tried
first in one position, then in another, until it was decided
that they looked best arranged as in <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>. After that
the extra leaves for the middle spray, and the bud and its
leaves for the right-hand spray, were put in place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 426px;"><a id="Fig_20"></a>
<img src="images/i_026.png" width="426" height="390" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.20 - Large Red Clover design.</div>
</div>

<p>It all seemed charmingly satisfactory, so the design was
taken apart that it might be fastened permanently in place.
The middle spray had to be adjusted first, and a drop of
good library paste was put on the under-side of the clover-blossom,
a drop on the under part of each leaf, and on the
under part of the stem at the lower end. Then the spray
was laid in the middle of the paper just where it was at
first, and pressed down to make it stick. Paste was put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
on the under part of each of the three leaves to be added
and on the under part of their stem at the end, and they
were pasted down to look as if growing on the main stem,
opposite the other leaves.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 554px;">
<a id="Fig_21"></a>
<img src="images/i_027a.png" width="554" height="353" alt="drawings" />

<div class="caption">Fig.22 - Parts of leaf and bud design.</div>
</div>

<p>Next the left-hand spray was pasted in place in the
same way, then the right-hand spray, to which was given
its bud that curves in to almost touch the bud on the other
spray. Paste was also put half-way down on the under
part of the long stems of each of the side sprays.</p>

<p>This completed the clover design and it was exceedingly
pretty, but after it had been sufficiently admired it was
placed between papers under several heavy books to press,
that it might be more durable. It was after it had been
pressed that it looked like a piece of silk embroidery.</p>

<p>Pasted designs can be made without pressing; but while
they are more beautiful they will not last as long as the
others. You can enjoy your fresh designs for a while and
then press them. Do not make the mistake of covering
the entire under part of a flower or leaf with paste as if
it were made of paper; a drop is all that is needed, more
will spoil it.</p>

<p>Flowers do not always grow exactly as you want them
for your designs, but a too straight stem can be coaxed
to curve by drawing it between your fingers, and leaves
and sprays can be cut away or added as has been shown.
All this changing about only makes it more fun to work
out the design.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18</a> is a running design of clovers which can be used
for a border. The little arrows on <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a> show where the
different parts are joined.</p>

<p>The large red clover was used for the design <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a> and
the leaves and buds of the red clover for <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a>. <a href="#Fig_22">Fig.
22</a> shows how the parts of <a href="#Fig_21">Fig. 21</a> are put together. These

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>OTHER WILD-FLOWER DESIGNS</small></h2>


<h3>Daisy Fleabane Design</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Isn't</span> the design <a href="#Fig_23">Fig. 23</a> what grown-ups call Japanesque?
Doesn't it look as if it had been copied from a printed
pattern on a piece of Japanese cotton cloth?</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 479px;">
<a id="Fig_23"></a>
<img src="images/i_029.png" width="479" height="392" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.23 - Daisy Fleabane design</div>
</div>

<p>Well, it was not. It is from a design made especially
for you of real wild flowers, freshly gathered. The name
of the flower is the daisy fleabane which grows in almost
all open grassy fields where daisies and buttercups and
clovers are found.</p>

<p>The illustration <a href="#Fig_24">Fig. 24</a> shows how the daisy fleabane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
looks when first gathered. Sometimes the blossom is entirely
white, sometimes it is tinged with purple, and it has
a bright-yellow centre. Its petals are as fine as a fringe,
like those of the asters that blossom in the fall.</p>

<p>In making the design the full-blown flowers were pressed
down flat, which makes them round like a sunflower,
while the buds and partly open flowers were left as they
naturally grew. The composition, or arrangement, of this
design is like that used for the upright clover design (<a href="#Fig_16">Fig.
16</a>), that is, it has two tall side sprays and a shorter middle
spray; but see how very different the two designs are in
appearance. The clover is all graceful curves, the daisy
fleabane is stiff and formal with straight lines and angles.</p>

<p>If you use the white flower, make the design on a sheet
of tinted paper, else the flower will not show. All white
flowers should have tinted paper for a background.</p>


<h3>Wild Mustard Design</h3>

<p>The small, yellow blossoms of the wild mustard and
its compound leaves make very dainty designs. <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>
is one of them.</p>

</table></div>





<p>From the drawing of the wild mustard (<a href="#Fig_26">Fig. 26</a>) you will
see that the flowers do not grow close to the leaves as they
are placed in this design, but on tall stems which lift them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a><br /><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
far above the scattered leaf-sprays. The design <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>
was made by cutting off a number of flower-clusters and
leaves, and grouping first one flower-cluster and one leaf-spray
together, with the ends of their stems touching, then
another flower-cluster
and another leaf-spray.
The arrows in <a href="#Fig_27">Fig. 27</a>
show where the stems
are brought together,
and the design <a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>
shows how the joining
of the first two is covered
with one of the
small leaves of the second
leaf-spray, and how
the joining of the second two is hidden under a leaf of the
third leaf-spray, and so on.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.27 - Parts of Wild Mustard design.</div>
</div>

<p>There are four flower-clusters and five leaf-sprays in
the design. You can have as many as you wish but must
end them with a leaf-spray.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 542px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.28 - Buttercup design.</div>
</div>


<h3>Buttercups&mdash;a Design</h3>

<p>Buttercups are so beautifully golden, so glossy and
bright, you would think they could be made into many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
nice things, a gold necklace for instance. And so they
could if they only would not wilt almost as soon as they
are gathered. To be sure, they will revive and freshen up
when put in water if they are not too much wilted, but
we cannot make them into jewelry while their stems are
in water.</p>

<p>Still there is something buttercups can be used for, and
that is designs. <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a> is a drawing from the simplest
kind of a buttercup design but a pretty one. It shows
five wide-open blossoms placed in a row at equal distances
apart with a little spray of leaves and bud at the lower
end of each stem. These sprays do not grow as they are
in the design but are added after the flowers are placed
in a row.</p>

<p>As in all other designs, each flower, bud, and stem is
touched with paste on the under-side to hold it in place
on the paper. A design like <a href="#Fig_28">Fig. 28</a> should be pressed after
it is arranged, and it will last a long while and keep its
bright color. A number of other and very beautiful designs
can be made of the common wild buttercup.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>PUSSY-WILLOWS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> all welcome and love the dear little pussy-willows
(<a href="#Fig_29">Fig. 29</a>) whose fur is so soft and silvery. How pretty
they look sitting along the slender,
bare branches of the small American
willow-tree which is their home.

<h3>Pussy-Willow Rabbits</h3>

<p>Take a small branch of the very
largest pussies you can find, have
ready some scraps of smooth, fresh
writing-paper, a piece of cardboard,
pair of scissors, and some good paste.
It only requires long ears to change
the pussy-willows into bunnies. Cut
the ears from your writing-paper like
the pattern <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>. Put paste on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the strip between the letters G and H, then take a pussy
from the branch and stick the paste-covered strip just
above the small end of the pussy, which will be the bunny's
head. The arrow I, <a href="#Fig_30">Fig. 30</a>, points to the place for
the ears. When the paste has dried bend the ears up
like the ears of the rabbits in <a href="#Fig_31">Fig. 31</a>. Make three or
four rabbits to keep each other company and paste them
in a row on your piece of cardboard.</p>

<h3>A Pussy-Willow Squirrel</h3>

<p>This little gray squirrel (<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a>), sitting up in such a
lifelike pose, must be made of a slightly bent, rather long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
slender pussy. Pull forward some of the fur near the small
end so that it will look like the front legs of the squirrel
when he holds a nut in his hand-like front paws, and push
up two tufts on the head for ears. The pussy from which
<a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32</a> was made already had these tufts for legs and ears,
and it looked so much like a squirrel one simply had to
add the tail and let it be a squirrel.</p>

lap, and stick the lap to the under part of the large end of
the pussy; then paste the finished squirrel to a piece of

<h3>Pussy-Willow Bumblebee</h3>

<p>Mr. Bumblebee (<a href="#Fig_34">Fig. 34</a>) needs one whole pussy for his
body, one-half of a pussy for his big, round throat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a small piece of the pussy for his head (<a href="#Fig_35">Fig. 35</a>). On the
piece of cardboard which is to hold the bee, draw his legs
like <a href="#Fig_36">Fig. 36</a>, then paste the three parts&mdash;body, throat, and
head&mdash;on top of the legs. <a href="#Fig_37">Fig. 37</a> shows how it would look
underneath if you could
see through the paper, so
you will know exactly
where to paste first the
throat, then the head, and
lastly the body. The edges
of these parts where they
join must be pushed close
together.</p>

<p>Choose a large pussy-willow for this mouse, ruffle the
fur up on top of the head and it will look like ears. The
head is at the small end of the pussy. Paste one end of a
piece of cotton string under the large end of the mouse,
and that will be his tail. The string should be white.</p>

<h3>Jumping Pussy-Willows&mdash;a Game</h3>

<p>This is a good game and it will make you laugh to see
the pussies leap up in the air, sail along a short distance,
and land on a numbered square of the game-board.</p>

<p>The board (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>) should be ten or twelve inches
square. Cut it from a flat, even box lid or any other
pasteboard you happen to have. Draw straight lines from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
top to bottom about one inch apart, then more straight
lines from side to side one inch apart. This will divide the
board into squares like a checker-board. Each of these
squares must be numbered and you can draw or paste them
in. <a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a> shows how the game-board should look.</p>

<p>To play the game, lay the board down on a flat surface,
a stone will do if you are out-of-doors, or even the ground;
and a table, if in the house. In front of the board draw
a short line for the starting-post. The line should be ten
or more inches from the board according to the distance
you can make the pussies jump. Any number of players
may join in the game and each player should have his
own jumping pussy.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a> shows how to place the pussy under the tip of
your right forefinger, with the large, blunt end standing
a little out beyond the finger-tip. When ready to shoot,
press down suddenly on the pussy and, as your finger slides
off the small end, away jumps pussy and lands on a square
of the game-board. Each player plays in turn, always,
of course, placing the pussy on the starting-line when shooting.
The player whose pussy lands on the highest number
wins the game. Jumping pussy-willow can also be played<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
by dividing the players into two even sides; then the side
which has the highest score, after the numbers won by
them have been added up, is the winner.</p>


<h3>Pussy-Willow Bouquet</h3>

<p>A nice, big bunch of pussy-willows makes an attractive
bouquet, and a very welcome one early in the spring. "The
pussies are out!" we hear some one say, and then the boys
and girls vie with one another in their effort to be the first
to find and bring home branches of the little catkins as
proof that spring has come and they were the first to see
her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>ARRANGEMENT OF FLOWERS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> arrangement of flowers is interesting and means
a great deal. It means that this chapter will tell you what
wild flowers look prettiest on the dinner-table and in bowls
and vases in other parts of the house; what flowers and
vines will keep fresh longest, and the kind that do not
need water but are beautiful when dry. It means that
you can learn not to force a tightly packed handful of all
sorts of flowers into a small vase and expect them to look
well. Flowers don't like crowding and are quite particular
about their associates.</p>

<p>If you come in hot and tired after your walk, put the
flowers you have gathered into a pail of fresh water and
let them stay there until you have rested and are ready
to sort them out and make each kind look its very best.
All flowers do not appear well in stiff, straight vases; all
do not look well in bowls. That is the first thing to learn,
and the next is that while some flowers seem to smile upon
and nestle lovingly up to some others, there are kinds that
they seem to draw away from and frown upon. Only a
few examples can be given here. If you love the flowers
you will find out more for yourself.</p>


<h3>The Wild Morning-Glory</h3>

<p>In your walks through the fields and along the country
roadsides have you ever noticed the wild morning-glory?
Of course, you have seen it and, perhaps, gathered some
blossoms, only to find them in a short time wilted in your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hand or turned into little, long bags, puckered at the top
as if drawn up with a string.</p>

<img src="images/i_044.png" width="593" height="496" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.44 - This is the way the Wild Morning Glory looks.</div>
</div>

<p>When I say noticed, I mean have you thought about
the flowers while you looked at them? Have you noticed
their shape and beautiful color, and have you seen the
great difference between the green leaf of the wild morning-glory
and that of the cultivated one?</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 436px;"><a id="Fig_45"></a>
<img src="images/i_045.png" width="436" height="599" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Fig.45 - The Wild Morning Glory blossomed
after it was gathered.</div>
</div>
<p>The wild morning-glory leaf (<a href="#Fig_44">Fig. 44</a>) is more beautiful
in shape, the vine is more graceful, and the blossom just
as lovely as the cultivated morning-glory, and all this
beauty need not be left behind when you gather the
wild flowers which are to make the rooms of your home
charming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>While I write this, July 7, there stands on a table in our
living-room a tall glass vase, wide at the top and holding
plenty of water. It is filled with a mass of wild morning-glory-vines,
and there are four new, entirely open, pink
and white blossoms while others are just twisting open.</p>



<p>Four days ago, when out for a walk in the country, I
gathered the vine by the roadside where it grew in the
company of daisies, buttercups, and wild mustard. Lifting
themselves up into the light, where the warmth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
morning sun could open the buds and where the leaves
could breathe in the fresh air, some of these trailing vines
had wound themselves in masses around tall, strong weed-stalks.</p>

<p>I gathered the vines, weed-stalks and all, breaking them
off close to the ground; and now these stalks hold most
of the vines upright in the vase, while other sprays droop
gracefully over the edge and hang down almost to the
table-top. Only one or two flowers were in bloom when
I found the vines, but there were quantities of green buds
which I hoped would open later, and that is just what
they are doing. It is like having wild flowers growing in
one's window. And as for decoration, nothing can be more
beautiful (<a href="#Fig_45">Fig. 45</a>).</p>

<p>Trailing vines always make pretty decorations, and
many wild ones keep fresh a long while when given plenty
of water. Some have flowers, some have not, but in any
case they are worth gathering when you have large vases
to fill.</p>


<h3>The Wild Balsam-Apple</h3>

<div class='unindent'>or as some people call it, the wild cucumber, is very
decorative. That means it has beautiful curves and twists,
and its small, white flowers, prickly, egg-shaped fruit, and
long tendrils twisted spirally, like a steel watch-spring let
loose, make us love to look at it. The leaves are pretty,
too, being shaped almost like a five-pointed star. Sometimes
this vine is cultivated and you will find it trained
up on strings to shade the porch, or over the kitchen-door
of a farmhouse. Wherever you find it, it is beautiful. A
large jar filled with sprays of the wild balsam makes a
good centrepiece for the table, or a tall vase holding some
upright and some drooping sprays looks very pretty when
placed near a window where the light will fall on it. Do
not mix other flowers with it, its own blossoms are sufficient.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>


<h3>Wild Clematis</h3>

<p>The wild clematis is another beautiful vine, and you
will find it clambering over fences and bushes along the
country road. Its masses of white flowers fill the air with
a sweet, spicy perfume that delights you.</p>

<p>You can gather the clematis when it is in blossom, and
keep it fresh in water for some time if you put it in root
ends down. This vine does not wilt as you carry it. Later
in the season, when the white flowers have turned into
balls of silvery fringe, the vine is lovely in a different way.
Then you can gather great armfuls and take it home to
hang over mirrors or picture-frames, letting it become
quite dry. It is best to strip the leaves off the sprays at
first because they are not beautiful when dry. In a day
or two after hanging up your clematis the balls of fringe
will become a mass of soft down which will cling to the
vine for many weeks. Later, when it becomes dusty, take
it down.</p>


<h3>Bittersweet</h3>

<p>Then there is bittersweet, another wild vine that we
gather in the fall. It covers fences and bushes as the
clematis does, but instead of turning into fringe balls its
small, creamy white flowers become bunches of berries.</p>

<p>The berries are yellow at first; when ripe they split open
and curl back to show the brilliant red seeds inside that
look like coral beads.</p>

<p>Gather the bittersweet while the berries are yellow,
strip off the green leaves, and hang the vine up dry or put
it in a large vase without water. Then the berries will
open and last all winter.</p>


<h3>Snapdragon and Wild Carrot</h3>

<p>Both of these are pretty flowers and worth gathering.
The snapdragon (perhaps you call it butter-and-eggs) does
not mind at all where it grows. Field, roadside, or even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the village streets may be its home, but wherever it lives,
it makes the spot shine joyously with its stalks of yellow
blossoms. Snapdragons combine well with the wild carrot,
whose other name is Queen Anne's lace, and together
they make a delicate and beautiful bouquet.</p>

<p>If you have a large glass fish-globe fill it with fresh
water, and put in the snapdragon and wild carrot in a
loose bouquet. Nothing could be prettier for the August
lunch-table than this.</p>


<h3>Wild Roses</h3>

<div class='unindent'>look best in a low glass bowl, for they have no stems to
speak of. Short-stemmed flowers do not belong in tall
vases. The roses wilt quickly out of water and should
have plenty of it.</div>

<p>Do not put any other kind of flowers in the bowl; the
roses won't like it; neither will you when you see how
much better they look by themselves.</p>


<h3>Daisies and Buttercups</h3>

<div class='unindent'>so friendly in the fields, look pretty when arranged in a
deep jar together, but I would not mix daisies with any
other flowers, unless it is the lacy wild carrot. Buttercups
look well with the carrot, too, and buttercups look
pretty mixed with grasses. You see they all know each
other very well, growing in the fields together.</div>


<h3>The Wild Flag, or Iris</h3>

<div class='unindent'>whose home is along the banks of ponds and small streams,
should be put into a tall clear glass vase or pitcher, where
its stems will show through, that it may look its best.</div>

<p>There is the yellow iris, the white and the purple, and
they are very beautiful when combined but not crowded.
Always put some of the long-spiked leaves in with the
flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>


<h3>Clover Bouquets</h3>

<p>Clover bouquets make delightful centrepieces for the
table. Arranged loosely with its own green foliage, the
rose-colored clover is especially beautiful in a clear, green
glass bowl of water. The sprays should be brought over
the edges of the bowl, and allowed to droop down, resting
partly on the table.</p>

<p>Yellow clover and its foliage mingled with white clover
makes a charming combination as a bouquet for almost
any occasion. The name of the yellow clover is hop-clover.
It is not as common as the other kinds.</p>


<h3>Green Bouquets</h3>

<p>When there are no flowers to be had you can have
bouquets and centrepieces of green leaves, ferns, and vines,
and you will be surprised to find what pretty ones can be
arranged and how much they will be admired.</p>

<p>Ferns will wither soon unless taken up with the roots
and the soil surrounding them; but if they have the roots
and soil they will last a long while, provided you put them
in a bowl or jar and keep them <i>always wet</i>. That does
not mean to water them as you would any other growing
plant, but to keep them <i>standing</i> in water <i>all the time</i>.
Maidenhair-fern kept in this way makes a delicate and
beautiful centrepiece for the table.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will find varieties of foliage that are
full of color. In early summer the young leaves of the
scrub-oak are very brilliant in reds and yellows, and I have
made bouquets of nothing but leaves from the rose-bushes.
These are often tinged with red and purple. Sprays of
the barberry-bush with its rows of dangling red berries
are pretty in a green bowl. Be careful of the thorns when
you gather this. Cut the stems; do not try to break them.</p>

<h2><i>PART II</i><br />
<small>GRASSES</small></h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>FAIRY-TREES MADE OF GRASSES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of our grasses appear like very large trees to the
little grass fairies who, we like to pretend, hide in their
midst; while other grasses, with their jointed, bamboo-like
stems, seem to these tiny people to be tall forests of
real bamboo.</p>

<p>Why not play that you are a little fairy and live among
the grasses? But to see the grasses as the fairies see them
you must lie down and bring your eyes very near the
ground; so stretch yourself out flat, face down, with your
head lower than the grass tops; then look steadily ahead
through the tall grass stems. What do you see?</p>

<p>The five fairy-trees standing by themselves in <a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46</a>
are four short-stemmed tops of the Scribner's panic-grass.
<a href="#Fig_47">Fig. 47</a> shows exactly how the grass looks before you pick
it, and <a href="#Fig_48">Fig. 48</a> gives a simple design that you can make
by placing the tips of the four grass tops together, allowing
the stems of two heads to lie in a straight horizontal
line (that means a line running from left to right), and
the stems of the other two heads to lie in a straight line
vertically (that means up and down).</p>

<p>While you are playing with the grasses you can begin
to learn something about them. The beard-grass, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
some people call the little blue-stem (<a href="#Fig_49">Fig. 49</a>), has near relatives
named forked beard-grass and bushy beard-grass.
These are stiff and angular, with bamboo-like stems, just
the thing for trees in a little Japanese garden which some
time you will want to make. You may run across them
anywhere, for they are common in all parts of our country.</p>

<p>Make friends with these and with other grasses. As
you find them learn their names just as you would learn
the names of new playmates. Take the grasses home,
show them to your father and to your mother; if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
do not know their names, carry them to school and ask
your teacher about them. In case she cannot tell you, go
to the public library with your grasses and persuade the
librarian at the desk to help you find their pictures and
names in some of her books. All grasses have names, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
keep asking and hunting until you know what to call them.
When you know their names you will be glad to see your
friends, the pretty green grasses, whenever you find them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>A HOUSE MADE OF GRASS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Real</span> people live in grass houses way off in the Philippine
Islands. That is, their houses are made of bamboo, which
is a kind of giant grass. It must be a pretty airy, comfortable
house in summer, and it is always summer in the
Philippines, but we never see that kind of houses here.
One reason is because in most of our country a grass house
would be very cold in winter, and another reason for not
building them is because the bamboo grows only in the
extreme south, and even down there people want more
substantial homes.</p>

<p>A prettier playhouse, though, could not be devised, and
if you could see a Filipino house you would want it immediately,
but since you cannot have a real one you can have
the fun of making a little doll Filipino house, and of
making it exactly as the little brown Filipino men make
theirs. Suppose you gather some grass and twigs now,
and build the little house for your doll.</p>

<p>Some of the queer little people whose home is in the
Philippine Islands perch their houses like birds' nests up
in the trees, but often they are built on stilts to lift them
high from the ground. Our little house (<a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>) shall
be on stilts. We will make the floor first. If you do not
understand how to measure by inches, ask an older person
to help you.</p>


<h3>The Floor</h3>

<p>Find two straight, round sticks, not quite as large round
as a lead-pencil. The sticks must be cut six and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
inches long, then two sticks of the same kind five inches
long; after that there must be six more sticks five inches
long. Split these last six sticks in half lengthwise.</p>

<p>The Philippine people do not use nails, or screws, or glue,
and not even wooden pegs, in building their houses; they
bind and tie the parts together with rattan, and as we are
going to build just as they do we, too, will tie the parts
of our house together, but will use raffia in place of the
rattan.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.50 - The little Grass House you can make.</div>
</div>

<p>Hold one of the six-and-a-half-inch sticks (letter J, <a href="#Fig_51">Fig.
51</a>) upright in your hand while you cross it a short distance
below the top with a five-inch-round stick (letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
K, <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>). The distance from the top of the upright
stick to the crossing and the distance from the short end
of the other stick to the crossing must be the same.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.52 - Carry the raffia over and

</div>

<p>Begin binding them together as shown in <a href="#Fig_51">Fig. 51</a>. Then
carry the raffia (string will do if you cannot get raffia) over
and between the two ends of the sticks
(<a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52</a>), and wind it opposite ways
several times around
the sticks, bringing
the raffia between as
well as over them.
This will lash them firmly together. Now turn this beginning
of your floor around so that the short stick will be
upright and the long one extend from side to side. Do
not let the binding loosen; hold it tight and cross the long
stick with one of the split five-inch sticks (<a href="#Fig_53">Fig. 53</a>). Be
sure that the flat side of the split stick is next to the long
stick, and that you leave a slight opening between it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the first crosspiece. Pull the raffia tight and bind it
over this second crosspiece (<a href="#Fig_54">Fig. 54</a>), then back, crossing
it as in <a href="#Fig_55">Fig. 55</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 334px;">
<a id="Fig_53"></a><a id="Fig_54"></a><a id="Fig_55"></a>

<div class="caption">Fig.53 - Turn the sticks, bringing J
in horizontal position.<br />Fig.54 - Bind raffia over second stick.
<br />Fig.55 - Then bring raffia across front
of second stick</div>
</div>

<p>Bind on the next split crosspiece in the same way, and
go on adding crosspieces until they reach almost to the
end of the long stick,
then let the last crosspiece
be the second
unsplit five-inch stick.
When all the short
crosspieces are properly
bound onto the
long stick, bind the
other six-and-a-half-inch
long stick under
the opposite ends of
the crosspieces in the
same way, and just as
carefully (<a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56</a>).
This makes the floor
and we must lash it to
the stilts, which are
four upright sticks,
each seven and one
half inches long. Fit
the stilts in the outside
corners made by the crossing of the end and side sticks of
the floor, and, holding the floor about four and a half
inches above the lower ends of the stilts, bind floor and
stilts together (<a href="#Fig_57">Fig. 57</a>). Of course you can put the stilts
on only one at a time.</p>


<h3>The Walls</h3>

<p>Make the framework for the walls by binding and tying
onto the stilts near the top two sticks, each six and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
inches long, one stick on
each side. Across these
sticks, from stilt to stilt, at
each end, bind a five-inch-length
stick (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>).</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.56 - Make the floor this way.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Roof</h3>

<p>To support the roof
there must be two upright
sticks, each seven inches
long, and these sticks must
be bound and tied to the middle of the end sticks of the
floor and the end sticks of the wall. They are lettered
L and L in <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 314px;">

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a> shows the framework of the house without the
bindings, so that you may see exactly how the sticks are
put together. There is a ridge-pole which forms the top
ridge of the roof. This must be a stick about seven inches
long, and it is to be tied to the uprights lettered L and L<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
that you have just fastened on the two ends of the house.
(See <a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59</a>, L and L.) Four other sticks, M and M and
N and N, long enough to reach from the ridge-pole, crossing
above it, to the side crosspieces of the wall, you must tie
to the ridge-pole and the side-wall sticks, placing them
slanting, as you see them in <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a>, at each end.</p>


<h3>The Porch</h3>

<p>Like many other people, the Filipino wants a porch
to his house. Perhaps he sits there to smoke his curious
little pipe, which is not much larger than the one you make
of an acorn. I have never seen him on his porch, but I
have seen him smoke and afterward tuck his pipe away
in his long, fuzzy hair, where it remained in safety even
while he leaped and pranced about in the wild dance he
loves so much.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 279px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.60 - This is the way the house
is put together.</div>
</div>

<p>But we must not forget the porch.   If the Filipino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
has one to his house, we must have a porch to ours. We
won't make it separately and add it to the part already
built, but, as the Filipino does, we will use part of the
house-floor for the floor
of the porch, and let the
roof cover that as well
as the house. To do
this we must separate
the house part from the
porch part by putting
up two more uprights,
one on each side, a little
way back from the front
of the house, and these
uprights will form the
boundary-line. Letters
O and P in <a href="#Fig_60">Fig. 60</a> are
these last uprights, the
sticks which form them
being long enough to
reach from the wall side-piece
to the floor, and
extend a little above
and below where they
cross the upper and
lower sticks.</p>

<h3>Thatching</h3>

<p>Now we come to the
real grass part of the
house, for we have had to use small sticks for the framework
instead of bamboo, and where the Filipino uses palm-leaves
we will use grass.</p>

<p>Gather some long, coarse, fresh blades of grass for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
thatching both the roof and walls, and begin with the walls.
Bunch the grass evenly, the stem ends all together, bend
the bunch at the centre, then spread it out at its centre,
and hang it thickly over one side-wall beam, which is the
upper stick (<a href="#Fig_61">Fig. 61</a>). Have the stem ends inside the house
hang down as long as the tip ends on the outside, and
let the outside ends hang
down below the edge of
the floor; then take a flat
strip of wood and place it
near the top of the grass-covered
wall, bend the
ends a little and slide
them back of the uprights
(<a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a>). Smooth the
grass down evenly and put
in another flat stick, this
time at the bottom (<a href="#Fig_62">Fig.
62</a>). If you want the inside
of the house as perfect as
the outside, slide in two
other strips on the inside
of each wall to hold the
grass down. <a href="#Fig_62">Fig. 62</a> shows
the grass partially trimmed
off to make it even at the
bottom.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.65 - Hang grass over ridge

</div></td></tr>
</table></div>






<p>To thatch the roof you
will need two more sticks
for rafters. Over one stick,
near the end, tie a bunch of grass into a tassel, using a
piece of raffia to bind it; hang more grass over the stick
or rafter, and tie it into another tassel, and with the same
piece of raffia tie a third tassel (<a href="#Fig_63">Fig. 63</a>). <a href="#Fig_64">Fig. 64</a> shows
exactly how the raffia is tied. Make the tassels rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thick and put them close together so that there will be
no space between.</p>

<p>When this rafter (the stick) is covered with thatch lay
it across the side of the roof half-way between the ridge-pole
(top stick on the roof) and the stick forming the side
wall of the house, and tie the ends securely to the slanting
sticks of the roof. Thatch another rafter and fasten it
on the opposite side of the roof, then cover two shorter
sticks with thatch and tie one across the front, the other
across the back peak of the roof on a line with the thatched
rafters on the sides.</p>

<p>Fasten more thatch at the front and back peak of the
roof, tying it to the ridge-pole, also to the two slanting
sticks. Allow the grass to hang down far enough to cover
the top of the thatch below it (<a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>). This thatch must
entirely fill up the ends of the roof made by the peak. Now
hang grass over the ridge-pole at the top of the roof as
you would hang your doll's little sheets on your toy clothes-line
(<a href="#Fig_65">Fig. 65</a>), and bring the ends down over the thatched
rafters on each side of the roof. Hold this top thatch in
place by laying sticks across the grass just below the ridge-pole
on each side of the roof. Bind and tie these sticks at
each end to the framework of the house (<a href="#Fig_50">Fig. 50</a>).</p>

<p>If grass cannot be had for thatching, soak hay in water
to make it soften and take the stiffness out, then use that.
Raffia dyed green might do, or should all else fail, take
fine broom-straws softened in hot water for the thatch, and
use loosely twisted string for binding and tying. Of course
the string should not be white, but you can dip it in coffee
and dry it; the color will then be like the color of rattan.</p>


<h3>The Ladder</h3>

<p>The spry little Filipinos use ladders instead of stairs
to reach their living-room, so we must make a rustic ladder
for our house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 192px;">
<a id="Fig_66"></a>
<img src="images/i_064.png" width="192" height="582" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.66 - The ladder will
be strong and firm.</div>
</div>
<p>Cut two slender sticks about six and one-half inches
long for the sides; then cut seven or eight short sticks
for the crosspieces or rungs. The rungs should be one
and three-quarter inches long. Bind and tie the ends of
the rungs to the side sticks (<a href="#Fig_66">Fig. 66</a>),
placing them about three-quarters
of an inch apart. The ends of the
rungs must cross the side sticks and
extend out about one-quarter of an
inch. If properly tied, your little
ladder will be firm and strong.</p>

<p>Place the ladder one end resting
on the ground, the other end on the
front edge of the porch, then stand
off and admire your work. It is
certainly worth admiring, for the
house will be a perfect miniature
Filipino home, and you may imagine
you can see tall cocoanut-palms
and many other strange and
beautiful trees and plants that grow
in the hot Philippine Islands. You
might copy some of these with
grasses and small flowering wild
plants.</p>

<p>If you have a Noah's ark it will
be a good idea to select some of
the animals that live in the Philippines
and put them in the little
rattan and bamboo jungles which you have made of
grasses. A piece of looking-glass or plain window-glass
can represent water not far from the house, and here you
should have a crocodile sunning himself on the bank. Let
a wild boar be plunging out of the jungle, and deep in the
bamboo grove you might hide the tremendously large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
snake called a boa. I don't think there will be a boa in
your Noah's ark, but you can make one of bread dough,
or of clay. With all these dangerous creatures prowling
round, do you think it strange that the Filipino people
put their houses on stilts?</p>

<p>If this were a real house in the real Philippines you might
see a number of natives, wearing little or no clothes, coming
toward you bringing small snakes which they had
caught to sell in the towns for rat-catchers. And near
the house there would be most wonderful flowers, some
of them orchids, the flowers that live on air; while all
around would be strange and rare birds.</p>

<p>At one side of the house, some distance away, there
would, perhaps, be a wet rice-field where the queer water-buffalo,
called a carabao, would be drawing a strange-looking
plough, the driver, a little brown man, wearing an immense
umbrella-like hat woven of palm-leaves.</p>

<p>Listen! Do you hear that deep, booming sound? It
comes from the peculiar tree which a native is striking
with his big club in slow, heavy blows on one of its immense,
wall-like roots. The sound goes rolling far over
the land, telephoning to other natives that white people
are coming.</p>


<h3>A Doll Filipino Woman</h3>

<p>To make the little house seem more real, dress a doll
in genuine Philippine costume and stand her near the
ladder with arms extended as if in welcome. The dress
must be a white waist with flowing sleeves, a light-colored
skirt, a large gay handkerchief, called a <i>pañuelo</i>, folded
around the doll's neck, and an overskirt made of a square
of dark cloth drawn tightly around her body from waist
to knees. No stockings are needed, but you can give her
heelless slippers with only a narrow strip over the toes
to keep them on.</p>

<p>Almost any kind of long, slender grasses can be used
for a dress of this kind, but you must gather an armful
or more. It takes a good deal of material, for the fringe
must be close and thick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Divide the grass into bunches, each bunch about as
thick as your thumb, and have the heads of all the grasses
together at one end of the bunch, and the stem ends together
at the other end.</p>

<p>Tie a strong string around the stem ends of one bunch.
Hold this tied bunch under your left arm, stem ends to

the long end of the string across the front of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
bunch and form a loop (A, <a href="#Fig_67">Fig. 67</a>). Hold the loop while
you pass the string around the back of the bunch (<a href="#Fig_68">Fig. 68</a>),
then slide the end through the loop A, <a href="#Fig_69">Fig. 69</a>. Draw
this loop-fastening very tight and it will hold. Now place
the second bunch under your arm with the first bunch,
and make a loop-fastening around the third bunch. Keep
on adding bunches of grass in this way, always drawing
the last bunch close to the one before it, and holding them
all together under your arm as in the photograph (<a href="#Fig_70">Fig. 70</a>).
In this picture the grass bunches are purposely left far
apart that you may see exactly how to make the fringe.</p>

a strip of fringe long enough to reach around your waist,

grasses to be worn over a light summer dress.</p>


<h3>Grass Head-Dress</h3>

<p>The grass head-dress to be worn with the wood-nymph
skirt is quite as wild-looking, but is simply a band of grasses,
with bunches of the bristle-spiked cyperus grass (<a href="#Fig_71">Fig. 71</a>)
hanging downward on each end. The band goes across
over the top of the head, and the grass side ornaments
fall over the ears.</p>

<p>Wear the grass costume and carry a light branch of green
leaves in each hand when you give your next outdoor fancy
dance, or take part in outdoor tableaux where you could
represent either a wood-nymph or the spirit of the grasses.</p>

if you would be a fashionable lady decked in jewels rare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
or a rollicking cowboy, or Robinson Crusoe, it is all the
same to Mother Nature's department store. Fields, Woods

ready to wear, they are at least ready to be made
up into what you want.</p>

<p>Why, you can even be a little savage and wear a skirt
made of a fringe of long grasses, like the wood-nymph's
dress, and bracelets of slender, golden-brown rootlets, if
that pleases you; all the materials are ready to your hand.

<h3>Robinson Crusoe Hat</h3>

<div class='unindent'>of the large leaves of the scrub-oak&mdash;a pretty and becoming
hat and one that will keep your head cool though you
walk under the hottest of noonday suns.</div>

<p>The photograph given here shows one little girl who
likes immensely to wear her Crusoe hat, and <a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a> shows
just how the hat looks when not on her head.</p>

<p>It won't take more than five minutes to make the hat,
but first you must gather the leaves. Ordinary oak-leaves
are too small to use; it is on the scrub-oak that you will
find them large enough. The scrub-oak grows low, like a
bush, and the leaves will be quite within your reach. Like
a good shopkeeper, this kind of oak shows his customers
leaves of various sizes, but it is the very largest that you
must take, and only the ones that are dark-green in color.
The pretty new light-green or brownish leaves will soon
wilt and curl on the edges, while a hat made of the older,
tougher ones will last in good condition several days if left
out in the dew at night or kept damp in the house.</p>

<div class="caption">The Robinson Crusoe Hat is pretty and becoming.</div>
</div>

<p>The number of leaves needed depends upon the size of
the leaves and the size of your head. It is well to have
at least a dozen and a half; then you can select the best.
The largest leaves are not always perfect, but unless very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a><br /><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
much torn or eaten away by insects they will answer. To
gather all you need you will probably have to visit several
of the little scrub-oaks.</p>

<img src="images/i_074.png" width="241" height="234" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.73 - Pin the leaves together
in this way.</div>
</div>
<p>If you are at home when you make your hat, use broom-straws
to pin the leaves together; if you are in the woods
find some smooth, slender twigs, break them in short pieces,
and they will take the place of the straws.</p>

<p>Begin by pinning two leaves together as they are in <a href="#Fig_73">Fig.
73</a>. These leaves are lettered
U and V. You see that U
is lapped over V and then
pinned to it in two places,
first near the stem and then
through the lower side lobe.
The next leaf would be letter
W, and W would be pinned
to U just as U is pinned to V.
Make the stems meet at the
top and keep adding leaves,
pinning one to another, until
the hat is large enough to fit
your head comfortably, then pin the last leaf to the first.</p>


<p>Do not make the hat too flat; if you find it flattening
out, lap the leaves over more at the bottom. When finished
it should be shaped like <a href="#Fig_72">Fig. 72</a>.</p>


<h3>Oak-Leaf Mask</h3>

<div class="caption">Fig.74 - The Oak Leaf Mask.</div>
</div>
<p>Among other frolics in the woods you can have a masquerade&mdash;a
real one, where you wear a mask, and that
mask made of one of the largest leaves of the scrub-oak.
Not even a pair of scissors will be needed to make this
mask, and it is a funny one too (<a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a>). See the turned-up
eyelids and the wide nose tilted at the end.</p>

<p>When you have found a leaf large enough (the one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the drawing was nine inches long and seven inches wide)
use your thumb-nail to cut out the eyes and nose.   The
outlines at the top of <a href="#Fig_74">Fig. 74</a> show how to shape them,
and the dotted lines show where they are bent up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no mouth, none is needed, for the leaf, below
the nose, drops down loosely over your mouth like the
curtain on a mask one buys at a shop. The oak-leaf mask
will stay on your face if you wet the under parts of each
side and stick them to
your cheeks.</p>

<p>Another way to make
the mask is to turn the
leaf around, stem down,
and then cut the eyes
and nose in the wide
part, leaving the narrower
stem end for a long chin. This kind you can hold
in front of your face by taking the stem in your hand. It
requires so short a time to make a mask that when one
wears out or is lost you can have another to replace it in
a minute or two.</p>

<h3>The Little Oak-Leaf Dog</h3>

<p>He has the funny expression of a real dog when he is
making up his mind what to do next, even if he is only an
oak-leaf. It was an ordinary leaf four inches long which
was, by tearing a little here and bending a little there,
transformed into his absurd dogship (<a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a> is the tracing of the leaf actually used for the
dog. <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a> shows the same leaf with its stem nipped
off and the other end torn up, not very evenly, where the
dotted lines are in <a href="#Fig_76">Fig. 76</a>. This makes the little dog's
tail. The tear on either side reaches to the mid-rib of the
leaf, but does not cross it, and the mid-rib being unbroken
holds the tail out stiff and straight.</p>

<p>The two hind legs are bent down just where the tear
ends in making the tail. The dotted line in <a href="#Fig_77">Fig. 77</a> shows
this. The other two legs, formed by the side lobes of the
leaf, are bent down as the dotted lines indicate. The tip
of the lobe on the left side had to be torn off because that
leg was longer than the opposite one.</p>

<p>In making the neck the narrow part of the leaf was bent
up and then down, the two dotted lines show where. Then
the ears were bent up and the little oak-leaf dog was placed
standing as you see him in <a href="#Fig_75">Fig. 75</a>, to have his picture
drawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<small>GRAPE-LEAF DRINKING-CUP</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A wild-grape</span> leaf will do quite as well as a cultivated
one for a drinking-cup if it is large enough. You want a
large leaf, because a small one will hold only a sip of water,
and when one is really thirsty that is certainly not enough.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 417px;">
<a id="Fig_78"></a>
<img src="images/i_079a.png" width="417" height="428" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.78 - The drinking cup was made
of a leaf like this.</div>
</div>
<p>Whether wild or cultivated, the grape-leaf should be
washed in clean water to take off dust and any possible
insects that may be on it. Where there is water to drink
there is water for washing the leaf, so there can be no difficulty
about that, and the large green leaf, freshened by
the water, looks very cool and inviting.</p>

<p>It is simply a matter of folding, first one way, then the
other, that turns the grape-leaf into a cup. <a href="#Fig_78">Fig. 78</a> is a
tracing of the leaf from which the cup (<a href="#Fig_79">Fig. 79</a>) was made.
It measured eight inches at its widest part, almost seven
inches from tip to stem, and the cup held a good supply
of water.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 430px;">
<a id="Fig_79"></a>
<img src="images/i_079b.png" width="430" height="330" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.79 - A fine drinking cup made by folding
a Grape leaf.</div>
</div>
<p>Begin to fold by bringing the two lower lobes of the leaf
together in the way shown in <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>. This makes the
middle bend that is indicated by the dotted line in <a href="#Fig_78">Fig.
78</a>. Then bring the two lobes around to the left, or to the
right if that comes easier, hold them close together and
lap them over the upper lobe on that side. That makes
the two side bends which join at the middle bend (<a href="#Fig_78">Fig.
78</a>), and rounds the cup into shape.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.80 - Bring the two lower lobes of the
leaf together.</div>
</div>

<p>The bottom of the cup is pointed, as you see, and,
of course, will not stand; then, too, the cup falls apart
when you loosen your hold, but neither of these things
are of any consequence, for you can let your cup lie flat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and fold it again very quickly when it is needed. As long
as the folds are held tight in your fingers, the cup will keep
its shape and hold water without leaking a particle. Use
the upper, or green, side of the leaf for the inside of
the cup; the under, or light, side is fuzzy and may harbor
small insects even after it is washed. Be sure you look
into the water before drinking it. This should be done
no matter what you drink from or where you get the
water.</p>

<small>GREEN-LEAF DESIGNS</small></h2>


<h3>Beech-Leaves</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Remarkably</span> pretty designs can be made entirely of
green leaves; also with leaves and their seed-pods, their
nuts and berries. You can press a design of leaves alone,
but one having seed-pods, berries, or nuts cannot be pressed.
It is fun to make it, even if it cannot be preserved by pressing,
and you will like to do it.</p>

</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_81">Fig. 81</a> is the drawing of a charming design made of
two twigs broken off a beech-tree. On one twig were two
beechnuts in their pretty green, spiky outer shells; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
the other was just one nut. Each twig had three leaves.
Nothing was cut off and nothing was added for this design;
the twigs were used exactly as they came from the
tree. The stems were
simply crossed, with the
lower leaf of one twig
falling over the stem of
the other twig, and that
finished it. The easiest
thing in the world to do
if you happen to think
of it.</p>


<h3>Violet-Leaves</h3>

<p>There is one thing
about the green leaves of
the violet which makes it
a joy to use them in a
design, and that is, the
stems are so pliable, so easily bent and curved, you can
do almost anything with them.</p>

<p>The curve of the stem of <a href="#Fig_83">Fig. 83</a> is a natural one for it
to take, and you can probably find a leaf with its stem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
curved very much like it, but it is another thing to come
across one of the same size which has a stem curved in the
opposite direction, and such a stem is necessary for a design
like <a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>.</p>

<p>Very well! Since the stem does not naturally curve
the way we want it, we will make it do so. All we have
to do is to draw it through our fingers several times and,
by pressure, gently persuade it to turn as we wish.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_84">Fig. 84</a> is the under-side of the small leaf at the bottom

<p>First a violet-leaf with stem curved like the one in <a href="#Fig_83">Fig.
83</a> was laid down on a sheet of paper, then another leaf
of the same size, with stem <i>made</i> to curve in the opposite
direction, was placed beside but not touching the first
leaf, and with its stem crossing the other stem. The two
stems meeting at the bottom formed a pear-shaped loop.
The small leaf, after its stem had been formed into a loop
and the end tucked in at the back, was fitted on top of
the stems of the large leaves, as you see it in <a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>.</p>

<p>Violet-leaves are seldom flat; they are apt to curl at the
edges; some are so curled as to form little cornucopias.
Choose the flattest you can find for a design like <a href="#Fig_82">Fig. 82</a>,
and paste them to the paper with a touch of paste on the
under-part of the tip and of the two lobes at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of each leaf. Paste the stems down also with a touch of
paste here and there.</p>

<p>The violet-leaf design can be pressed.</p>


<h3>Ground-Pine</h3>

<p>Deep in the shadowy woods, often where pine-trees are
growing, you will find the ground-pine. Clinging close
to the ground, curling in feathery, green clusters on its
vine-like root, it runs for yards over the surface, while its
root, lying along the top, sends down slender rootlets into
the earth. Push away the dry leaves or pine-needles that
usually cover the root, and you can pull up long strips and
soon gather enough to make the prettiest kind of festive
decorations.</p>

<p>Festoons of the ground-pine are very pretty on walls,
stair-banisters, porch-railings, over picture-frames, and
hanging from chandeliers, and this ready-made evergreen
rope is as suitable for outdoor as for indoor decoration, as
beautiful in summer as in winter.</p>

<p>When you want to "dress-up" in the woods use the
ground-pine for trimmings. Loop it over your skirt and
make a wreath for your hair. Last summer at camp we
used the ground-pine in this way and the little girls, arrayed
for a dance, never looked prettier. For table decorations
at camp and for decorating the tent doorways the
ground-pine is charming.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_85">Fig. 85</a> shows how the short, curled clusters grow on
the long root, and <a href="#Fig_86">Fig. 86</a> gives a wee pine-tree made of
one cluster picked off the root and planted in an outdoor
doll's garden.</p>

<p>This is what our American writer and poet, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, said of the ground-pine:</p>

<small>PHLOX</small></h2>


<h3>Phlox Tower and Phlox Design</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a great bunch of garden-flowers given me by a friend
I found some pink-and-white phlox (<a href="#Fig_87">Fig. 87</a>), and from it
I made first a</p>


<h3>Phlox Tower</h3>

<p>As you know, the blossom is trumpet-shaped and flares
at the open end into five petals. The tube part is long
and narrows to a point, so it is easy to push one flower into
another. That is what you do in building the phlox tower.
You pull the blossom off its stem and out of the little green
calyx which holds it, then you push the end of the tube
part into the round red eye in the centre of another flower
as far down as it will go. Then you push another blossom
into that one and build up until your tower is as high as
you want it, or as high as it will stand without toppling
over. A bud stuck in the top flower makes a good finish
(<a href="#Fig_88">Fig. 88</a>).</p>


<h3>Phlox Design</h3>

<p>The design <a href="#Fig_89">Fig. 89</a> was made by first putting three
blossoms together, sticking one inside the other as for the
tower, to form the long side sprays, and afterward arranging
three blossoms below the side sprays and one above<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
with their stems meeting at the middle, as they are in <a href="#Fig_89">Fig.
89</a>. On each side of the upper flower was placed a sprig
of buds; then the tube part of a blossom was cut off and
the petal part fitted in the centre of the design to cover
the ends of the other flowers where
they met.</p>

<h3>The Tiger-Lily Leopard</h3>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 411px;"><a id="Fig_90"></a>
<img src="images/i_089a.png" width="411" height="168" alt="drawing" />
<div class="caption">Fig.90 - The stealthy, prowling Leopard.</div>
</div>

<p>From the brilliant-orange tiger-lily, with its dark-brown
or black spots, we are going to make a&mdash;tiger? No, a
leopard. Tiger-lilies may have spots, but tigers, you know,
are striped.</p>

<p>It is really wonderful how much this little animal, made
of parts of a beautiful flower and broom-straws, looks like
the stealthy, prowling, wild creature which lives in Africa
and Asia. The yellow coat of the live leopard is covered
with black spots, and so is that of our flower leopard. The
fierce living animal has a long tail that it moves slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
back and forth in anger or when it threatens to attack another
animal or a man. Our little leopard also has a long
tail which, if it does not really move, looks as if it were
just going to. But while the live animal is ferocious and
will kill, we can only pretend that of the tiger-lily leopard.
Though he looks dangerous, he cannot even nibble a green
leaf.</p>

<p>The illustration of the tiger-lily given here is a drawing
of the one from
which the lily leopard
(<a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>) was made.
You will notice that at
the right of the flower
(<a href="#Fig_91">Fig. 91</a>) there is the
stem and pistil of a
blossom that has fallen
apart.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.91 - The leopard is made from a
Tiger Lily like this.</div>
</div>

<p>When we make the
leopard we cut off this
lily-stem close to the stalk, leaving the pistil attached, to
use for the back-bone and tail. Four broom-straws, about
an inch and a half long and sharpened at one end, we use
for legs. The pointed ends of two of the legs are pushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
into the stem at the front, and the other two in part of
the pistil at the back, as shown in <a href="#Fig_92">Fig. 92</a>. That makes

<p>Now we have to fit on the skeleton the leopard's spotted
coat. After pulling the perfect flower apart we select the
petal best suited for this purpose (<a href="#Fig_93">Fig. 93</a>), and then take
the curl partially out of it by pressing it down on the table
with our fingers. The tip of the petal will have to be cut
off because it comes down too far over the tail.</p>

<p>The blunt end of the petal will be the leopard's head,
and it can be rounded up and moulded with your fingers
until it looks like the head of the leopard in <a href="#Fig_90">Fig. 90</a>. Small
ears of bits of broom-straw, pointed at one end, we must
stick in the head where they belong and then, in order
to make the coat stay in place, we will pin it to the skeleton
at the neck, in the middle of the back, and again at the
tail, with fine broom-straws. So we have the little leopard
complete.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />
<small>CULTIVATED FOXGLOVE</small></h2>


<h3>Fairy-Caps</h3>

<div class='tnote2'><b>Transcriber's Note:</b> Foxglove is poisonous. Do not
play with foxgloves.</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Do</span> you know the cultivated foxglove with its tall spikes
of thimble-shaped flowers, prettily spotted inside? (<a href="#Fig_94">Fig.
94</a>.) And do you know that these flowers will fit on the
ends of your fingers like tall caps on the heads of little
fairies?</p>

<p>Perhaps there are foxgloves growing in your garden
now. If there are, pick five blossoms off the stalk, selecting
a large one for your thumb and a small one for your
little finger; the others should be of a size in between these
two.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 374px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.94 - "Do you know the cultivated
Fox Glove?"</div>
</div>
<p>Turn these blossoms upside down and they at once become
fairy-caps. Fit the caps on all five fingers of your
left hand. Then on your fingers, just below the caps, draw
little faces with pen and ink. Now you have five living,
moving fairies who will do all sorts of things and be very
spry about it (<a href="#Fig_95">Fig. 95</a>). They will nod at you joyously,
they will bend low in solemn salute, and they will put their
little heads together to plan some piece of mischief.</p>

<p>They can be fairy children at school, if you like, with
the short, fat thumb fairy for the teacher; and you can
make the fairy pupils stand close together, shoulder to
shoulder, then at a word from the teacher, separate and
stand alone again.</p>

<p>It will be fun to name the fairies, such names as Pepper-grass,
Mustard-seed, and Catnip, and with the teacher
standing before his class, have him call the roll and have
each fairy bob his head as he answers to his name.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will want the teacher to require each pupil
to sing a little song or recite a short verse. When a fairy
does that, he moves forward in front of the others, and
stays in that place until he has finished. Here is a pretty
verse for a flower-capped fairy to recite:</p>

<h3>Sweet Pea&mdash;the Peacock</h3>

<p>You use a little pretended magic when you turn a sweet-pea
blossom into a peacock, and that makes it seem more
mysterious and more interesting. It doesn't take a second
but while you are doing it you must repeat this transformation
rhyme:</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Sweet Pea, Sweet Pea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your petals unlock.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">I turn two down,</span><br />

</div>
<div class='unindent'>Pick out a fine, large sweet-pea blossom. It doesn't matter
about the color. If you have a number to choose
from, suit yourself.
Hold the flower in your
left hand by its stem
and recite the first two
lines:</div>

<div class='poem'>
"Sweet Pea, Sweet Pea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Your petals unlock."</span><br />

<div class='unindent'>Then as you reach

and put your thumb on
one curled petal, X, and
your first finger on the
other curled petal, Y (<a href="#Fig_96">Fig.

<div class='unindent'>and at the same time turn these petals down as they are
in <a href="#Fig_97">Fig. 97</a>. You will see right away that the turned-down
petals at the sides are the wings, the upright petal at the

<h3>Snapdragon&mdash;Lady's Head and Lion's Head</h3>

<p>The magic that turns a blossom of the large, cultivated

a dainty, ruffled sunbonnet, or into a ferocious-looking
lion's head, is the magic of pen and ink, not of rhyme.</p>

<p>The blossoms of the cultivated snapdragon are very
much larger than those of its wild cousin, called by some
people butter-and-eggs, but the cultivated flowers grow on
a stalk in the same way as the wild ones. You would
hardly recognize the cultivated flowers as snapdragons because
of their size and wonderful colors. A sure test is to
pinch one; if it opens its mouth it is a real snapdragon; if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
it doesn't it is not; but you must know how to pinch it,
else it may refuse to snap.</p>

<p>The illustration (<a href="#Fig_98">Fig. 98</a>) shows a stalk of the cultivated
flower, and looking at the blossoms in that position you
can see neither the lady's head nor the lion's, yet they
are there.</p>


<h4>LADY'S HEAD</h4>

<p>Pick a blossom off its stalk, leaving the little stem attached,
and turn it around until you discover the sunbonnet
and see that it looks like <a href="#Fig_99">Fig. 99</a>, then with pen
and ink draw eyes, nose, and mouth on the part under
the bonnet that is the face. This part is white, while the
sunbonnet is sometimes a dainty pink and sometimes a
gorgeous scarlet or orange, with deeper color on the edges.</p>


<h4>LION'S HEAD</h4>

<p>Turn another blossom upside down and the crown of
the bonnet becomes the lower jaw and beard of the lion,
while the other part is the lion's face. On the face you
must make two fierce eyes like those in <a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a>. When
you take hold of the lion's jaws at the back and pinch them
he will open his great, wide mouth as if to send out a tremendous
roar, only to snap it shut again without a sound
as you stop pinching. <a href="#Fig_100">Fig. 100</a> shows how to hold the
flower to open the lion's mouth.</p>

<p>The pink snapdragon is best to use for the lady's head
and the orange-colored one for the lion's. If you would
rather call it a dragon's head, you can, you know, but it
looks more like a lion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Miss Hollyhock gives a garden-party the scene
is a gay one. All the ladies, and you can have as many
as you want, are in their freshest, crispest summer gowns.
There are dainty pink ones, white, rose-colored, and deep
red; there are light yellow and orange; there are gowns
almost brown and others almost black, but whatever the
color of the skirt the waist is always green. Green waists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
are the style where Miss Hollyhock lives, and she and all
her friends follow the style very closely.</p>

<p>The hats these little ladies wear to the party are of the
same silky material as their
skirts and are usually of the
same color, though sometimes
a lady in white will appear in
a pink or yellow hat, or a pink
lady can be seen wearing a
white hat, and the lady in rose
knows how well she looks in a
hat that is almost black. When
there are two or more gowns of
the same color the hollyhock ladies prefer to have different
colored hats so that they will not all look alike.</p>

Miss Hollyhock.</div>
</div>

<p><a href="#Fig_101">Fig. 101</a> shows how Miss Hollyhock and her friends are
made from the flowers
of that name. When
you have gathered the
flowers you must cut
off the stem of each
close to the green calyx
which is Miss Hollyhock's
waist, and then
cut out the pistil which
grows inside the blossom.
This pistil is
shaped something like
a little club, and is
covered with the yellow
grains of pollen
(ask some one what
pollen is). It looks
like <a href="#Fig_102">Fig. 102</a>. The pollen will make the flower wilt
quickly. That is why it is best to take the pistil out.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Now select a nice, round, hard, green bud for a head
and leave its stem on for the neck. Turn the sharp point
of your scissors around in the top of the hollyhock calyx
to make a little round hole, then push the stem of the bud
into the hole, screwing it round and round until the bud
almost, but not quite, touches the calyx.   If you push it
all the way down your lady will have no neck; her head
will grow directly out of her shoulders.</p>

<p>Wooden toothpicks are used for legs, arms, and support,
but strong broom-straws will answer as well, or
straight, slender twigs. Push three toothpicks, twigs, or
broom-straws up into the centre of the flower, two in front
and one at the back as you see them in <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a>. The
dotted lines show where they go inside the blossom. Be
sure to have all three the same length so that the little
lady will stand firmly. The arrows on <a href="#Fig_103">Fig. 103</a> show where
to insert the arms. Cut sharp points on the broom-straws
to make them slide in easily. Blunt ends will tear the

Pin the hat to the top of the lady's head with a pin or

<h3>A Tea-Table</h3>

<p>Make the tea-table of the hollyhock's round cake of unripe
seeds which most children call a cheese. This is covered
with a green case which is easily taken off and then
you have a round, white disk like a little table-top turned
up at the edge. Select the largest one you can find and push
the ends of three toothpicks or broom-straws into the under-side
for the table legs (<a href="#Fig_104">Fig. 104</a>). Now the tea-table
must have a</p>

Push two short straws into the bud in the places shown
by the arrows in Z (<a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>), one for the spout and one
for the handle. Cut the tops off smaller buds to make
them into teacups (A and B, <a href="#Fig_105">Fig. 105</a>). A drop of paste
at the bottom of the teapot and the cups will keep them

<small>DAFFODILS</small></h2>


<h3>Dancing Flowers and Whirligigs</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Daffodils</span>, yellow as sunshine, always come with the
beautiful springtime. The blossoms of the single daffodils,
with their tall, golden cups resting in the saucers of
lighter-colored petals, are the daintiest, though both single
and double are so like a song of cheerfulness it is a joy to
have them near. They look as if they wanted to dance
for sheer happiness and, wonder of wonders, you can actually
make them dance.</p>

<p>Gather a few of the single daffies, leaving on them the
very short stems which hold them to the main stalk. These
little green stems will be the stiff ornaments at the top
of the dancers' green caps when you turn the flowers upside
down, which is right side up for the dancers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>


<h3>Daffodil Dancers</h3>

<p>To make a flower stand alone and give it feet to dance
on, push three wooden toothpicks firmly up under the
little yellow skirt into the
centre of the blossom. It
doesn't matter if a flower
has three feet; like an insect,
it may have more
than two and it won't stand
on two. Spread the bottom
ends of the toothpicks
out a trifle like a tripod to
make the flower stand
steady (<a href="#Fig_106">Fig. 106</a>).</p>

<p>When you have made
several dancers, stand them
on a tin tray, and they
will be a group of "daffy-down-dillies
just come to
town," arrayed in their
best gowns and ready to
take part in the dance.
Tap the tray gently from
underneath and the dancers
will begin to move.
Tap a little harder and
they will begin to dance. Tip the tray slightly forward
and they will dance toward you; tip it backward and
they will dance away again.</p>

<h3>A Daffodil Animal</h3>

<p>Queer little animals that come only from Daffy land
can be made of the single daffodil-blossoms.   Take one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
the flowers and carefully cut away the outstanding petals,
leaving the perfect, long cup. Hold the cup in your left
hand with the short, green stem hanging down; the stem
is the animal's head; then break off about half an inch
from the blunt ends of four wooden toothpicks and use
the longest parts for legs. Push the pointed ends of the
tooth pick legs up into the under-side of the long, slender
cup as it is held in your left hand. Keep the legs of an
even length and the animal will stand firmly. This little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
fellow, with his green head and long green nose, is very
comical (<a href="#Fig_107">Fig. 107</a>). He can dance on the tin tray too, and
run about when you tip it.</p>

<p>The daffodil toys will keep their color a long while even
after the blossoms are dry. Do not take off the brown
calyx which is lightly wrapped around the bottom of each
flower. It represents the hair of the dancers and the ears
of the animal.</p>


<h3>The Whirligig</h3>

<p>You can have some fun with the daffodil stalk, too, after
taking off the flowers.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a> is a daffodil stalk; look at it closely, then look
at <a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>. They are really the very same though they
appear to be so different. One seems to have a blossom
at the top, and you know that the other has not.</p>

<p>If you want to do the trick and make a stalk blossom,
select a stalk like <a href="#Fig_108">Fig. 108</a>, hold the stem closely between
your open hands and roll it rapidly by first sliding your
right hand forward while the left slides backward, then
the left forward and the right hand back. This makes a
whirligig of your stalk, and the flower will appear at the
top as you see it in <a href="#Fig_109">Fig. 109</a>.</p>

<p>Try making whirligigs of other kinds of stems; of
grasses, twigs, and leaves.</p>

<p>One necklace can be entirely

<a href="#Fig_111">Fig. 111</a>, which is made of bronze-green
haws (<a href="#Fig_112">Fig. 112</a>), and the
long, green seed-pods of the plantain
(<a href="#Fig_113">Fig. 113</a>). The blossoms of
the plantain are pale purple or lavender, and hang from
the stalk as the seed-pods do. They are bell-shaped and
about an inch long. The leaf is like a lily-leaf.</p>

first a haw, then a seed-pod, again a haw and so
on. Thread your needle with strong thread and be sure
the thread is long enough for the necklace. Measure it
around your neck, letting it droop as much as you wish;
then allow several inches at each end for tying. If you
cannot find the large, brownish-green haws use yellow or
red ones, but the green haws, when strung with the green
seed-pods, are more beautiful.</p>

You see it is strung on a thread and the ends of the

just large enough to fit comfortably over your ear, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
when you wear the earring, the green jewel will hang down
and dangle delightfully. The upper end of the seed-pod
should almost touch your ear.</p>

Plantain-Stalk</h3>

<div class="caption">Fig.117 - Make the earring
in this way</div>
</div>
<p>Plantain is very useful in making
jewelry because you can use the
stalk as well as the seed-pods.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig_115">Fig. 115</a> is a necklace made of
the plantain-stalk cut in short pieces,
all the same length, and the coral-red
berries of the barberry-bush. The
crooked branches of the barberry-bush
grow very close together and
are covered with thorns which stand
out straight and sharp like pins.
That is why it is so often used for
hedges; nothing can get through it
without being terribly scratched.
From the branches the red berries hang down like coral
drops. <a href="#Fig_116">Fig. 116</a> shows the way they grow.
To make this necklace, string first a piece of the plantain-stalk,
pushing
the needle
through lengthwise,
then string
a barberry and
again a piece of
the green stalk;
after that a barberry. Keep on in this way until the
necklace is as long as you want it.</p>


<p>The berries are exceedingly pretty strung as you see
them, hanging down in their natural way, and really, you
cannot string them any other way.   The upper part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the berry is the only part through which you can pass your
needle because of the large, hard seed which fills the space
below.</p>


<h3>Plantain-Stalk and Barberry Earrings</h3>

<p>How to make the earrings to complete this set of jewelry
is shown in <a href="#Fig_117">Fig. 117</a>. First you string a piece of the plantain-stalk,
then a barberry; then you put your needle back
through the stalk and tie
the thread at the top.
After that you make the
loop to put over your
ear as you did in making
the seed-pod earring.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.118 - Maple seed vessel used as bird wings</div>
</div>

<p>You see it is not only
the seed-vessels of flowers
that can be turned
into playthings. The
trees also furnish abundant
material for toys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 351px;">

<img src="images/i_111.png" width="351" height="346" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.119 - Maple seed vessel bird.</div>
</div>

<p>Gather the winged seed-vessels that fall from the maple-trees,
<a href="#Fig_118">Fig. 118</a> is a maple seed-vessel, and let us sit on
the dry, sun-warmed grass and turn them into odd little
birds like <a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>. These birds are very near the size of
our ruby-throated humming-birds, a trifle larger perhaps,
but they do not in the least resemble the beautiful, jewel-colored,
long-beaked wild bird, either in looks or habits.
However, they are nice, tame, quiet little birds and never
object to being handled, played with, and placed on any
bush or low tree where you may happen to want to put
them. You cannot say that of the humming-bird, can you?</p>

<p>You will need two seed-vessels for each bird. Divide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
one through the centre, separating the two wings, and use
one of these wings for the body of the bird, as you see in
the diagram <a href="#Fig_120">Fig. 120</a>. Clip off the two corners of the
square end where the arrows point to shape it like a
bird's head, then carefully bend up the seed-vessel pair
of wings, and fit the body down in between them, resting
it on the centre part that holds the wings together. One
or two stitches with needle and thread, passed through
wings and body, will keep them close and secure.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 505px;">
<a id="Fig_120"></a>
<img src="images/i_112.png" width="505" height="300" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.120 - Bird's body.</div>
</div>

<p>When your bird is finished (<a href="#Fig_119">Fig. 119</a>), thread a needle
with black thread, tie a good-sized knot in the end of the
thread, and push the needle from underneath up through
the back of the bird where it will come out between the
wings. Draw the knot up close to the body and tie the
other end of the thread to a low branch of a tree. When
you stand off a little distance you cannot see the thread and
your bird will seem to be hovering in mid-air. A gentle
breeze will stir the bird and make it look as if flying. If
there is no breeze, you can blow on it, or fan it until the
little thing flutters about almost as if alive.</p>

<p>Be careful to string the thread through the bird at a
place that will make it evenly balanced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<small>BUCKEYE HORSE AND BUCKEYE RIDER</small></h2>


<p>All children love the clean, glossy, brown horse-chestnuts
or buckeyes. There are so many buckeye-trees in
Ohio that it is called the Buckeye State, and many villages
of Long Island are full of them. They are used for
shade-trees and often line the streets, where they send down
showers of their nuts, pretty but not good to eat. Everywhere
the children gather basketfuls and take them home
to play with, and in other Beard books we have told of some
things that can be made of buckeyes, but the buckeye
horse and rider which you see here have just arrived.</p>

<p>He is a very remarkable-looking horse with his funny
round head and stiff legs and tail, though not more remarkable
than the little man who rides him. Both are
made simply of buckeyes and slender twigs. The head
and body of the horse and of the man are buckeyes. The
neck, ears, tail, and legs of the horse are smooth, straight
twigs; the neck, arms, and legs of the man are also twigs.</p>


<h3>The Buckeye Horse</h3>

<p>When you make a horse let the light-colored part of the
buckeye be his face. This part usually has a dark spot
on it which looks like an eye. You will see it in <a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>.
He will have only one eye unless you put in another with
lead-pencil or pen and ink, but very frequently horses are
blind in one eye, so it will not matter whether he has two
eyes or one.</p>

<p>Stick two short pieces of twigs in the head for ears and
a longer twig for the neck. You will have to sharpen the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ends of the twigs to a point so that they will go in easily.
The neck twig will need sharpening at both ends.</p>

<p>Before putting the head on the body of the horse, which
should be as large a buckeye as you can find, push in four
twigs for the legs. The front legs must slant forward,
the hind legs slant backward. This will make him stand
firmly. Then choose a slender twig for the tail, and split
it several times at one end to show that it has hair on
it, as in <a href="#Fig_121">Fig. 121</a>.
Fasten the tail on
and then push in
the neck twig.
This finishes the
horse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 408px;">
<a id="Fig_121"></a>
<img src="images/i_114.png" width="408" height="277" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.121 - He is a remarkable looking Horse.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Buckeye Man</h3>

<p>For the body of
the man who sits
astride the horse,
choose a buckeye
which is rather flat
on one side. A
round buckeye will roll off. Find a small buckeye for the
man's head and give him a twig neck (<a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>). Do not
make his twig arms stand out straight at his sides; push
them in slantingly so that he will hold them out in front.
Put his twig legs in far apart and slant them a little
forward.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 387px;">
<a id="Fig_122"></a>
<img src="images/i_115.png" width="387" height="392" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.122 - The Buckeye Horse and Rider.</div>
</div>

<p>Now place the man on the horse, and if he does not fit,
change the position of his legs until he sits securely. Your
buckeye man and buckeye horse will then look like <a href="#Fig_122">Fig. 122</a>.</p>


<h3>Pine-Cones. Pine-Cone Forest</h3>

<p>Of course you like to gather the rich-brown pine-cones
that lie scattered on the ground under the pine-trees; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
all do. Collect a number of those which have loosened
and opened out their little leaf-like scales, then stand them
up like trees in an open space on the ground. They look
so much like toy trees we immediately want to play we
are foresters, way off in the wild western lands, planting
forest-trees for Uncle Sam.</p>


<p>We can make our forest as large as we want it and
plant trees every
day if we like, or
we can gather up
our nice, clean, dry
cones and take them
into the house to use
in some other way.
They make nice
playthings.</p>


<h3>A Fruit-and-Vegetable
Market</h3>

<p>If you find small,
short cones, not
fully opened out,
notice how much
they look like little
pineapples; you
must save these for our fruit-and-vegetable market, where
we sell fat, short acorns as hazelnuts, the long acorns as
pecans, and the buckeyes, or horse-chestnuts, all shiny,
dark, and smooth, as eggplants, and rose-haws as apples.</p>

<p>There are other things in our store, too. String-beans,
which are really locust-pods, and heads of white cauliflower
made of bunches of the wild carrot or Queen Anne's
Lace blossoms, tied together so that the pretty white flowers
of the wide-spreading clusters lie evenly with edges touching.
A number of these clusters are used for one head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
of cauliflower, and around each head are arranged green
leaves with their tops cut off just as you see them around
the real vegetable.</p>


<h3>Cone Card-Rack</h3>

<p>Save one of your fine, large-sized, wide-open cones and
make a card-rack of it like the one shown in the photograph
<a href="#Fig_123">Fig. 123</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;"><a id="Fig_123"></a>
<img src="images/i_116.jpg" width="431" height="492" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption">Fig.123 - Card rack and pin box combined.</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>You must have a small, round or square wooden box
for the base and glue the flat bottom of the cone on the
lid. The box can be filled with small brass clips for holding
sheets of paper together, or with pins, and it will then
make a fine birthday or Christmas present for some one.
The cone card-rack is very useful on a writing-desk.</p>

<p>If you make a number of these cone-racks they will be
something new for your next fair. Remember to stick
some pretty cards in each rack.</p>


<h3>Christmas-Tree Ornaments</h3>

<p>Perhaps you would like to keep some of your cones for
Christmas-tree ornaments; they make very pretty ones.</p>

<p>Gild several until they shine like gold, then silver others,
and they will look as if covered with white frost. If you
have collected any of the prickly sweet-gum balls that
look as if they were carved in little starry patterns, gild
and silver these, too, and let them dangle from the tree
on long gilt or silver cords.</p>

<p>These natural, outdoor ornaments are not easily broken,
and may be kept from year to year for your Christmas
tree.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />
<small>BURDOCK-BURRS</small></h2>


<h3>The Little House of Burrs</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> let us build a little woodsy house of burrs (<a href="#Fig_124">Fig. 124</a>)
and put it in a little garden. Gather two heaping handfuls
of large-sized burdock-burrs, small ones are not strong
enough, and begin building. These burrs grow on a bush;
they are about the size of a marble, are almost round, are
prickly, and are pinkish at the top.</p>

<p>Make the roof first (<a href="#Fig_125">Fig. 125</a>). Stick ten or twelve burrs
together in a row with pink heads all pointing in the same
direction. Place this row on a flat, smooth surface, a
board, flat stone, table, or, perhaps, the hard earth, and
attach another row of burrs along the side edge of the first
row. Continue to add more burrs until you have six or
seven rows fastened into one flat piece.</p>

<p>Be sure that this piece does not bulge out or sink down
in places, for the roof must be perfectly flat. Make the
two side walls (<a href="#Fig_126">Figs. 126</a> and <a href="#Fig_127">127</a>) and the back wall of
the house as you made the roof; the back wall must be
the length of the roof and the height of the side walls (<a href="#Fig_128">Fig.
128</a>). The side walls must each fit on the ends of the roof
and be high enough to look well.</p>

<p>The front wall of the house must have a doorway and
a window (<a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>). But first make it solid, exactly like
the back wall and exactly the same size, then lay it down
on the flat surface that you are using for a table, and open
a hole for the doorway by taking out five or six burrs,
counting from the bottom up, and two or three burrs,
counting from side to side. That will make about ten or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
twelve burrs to be removed. Take out the burrs for the
window and make the opening three or four burrs high and
two burrs wide. (See <a href="#Fig_129">Fig. 129</a>).</p>

<p>Use four burrs for each side of the hollow square chimney
(<a href="#Fig_130">Fig. 130</a>), which is open at top and bottom.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 589px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.124 - The little woodsey house of Burdock-burrs with
ornamental trees of grass</div>
</div>

<p>To put the different parts of the house together lay the
roof down flat and stick the edge of the back wall on top
of the outer row of burrs which forms one of the long edges
of the roof. Fasten one side wall on one short edge of the
roof in the same way and press the edge of the back wall
and the edge of the side wall together, making the corner
firm and square. Next attach the second side wall, and
lastly fit in the front wall.</p>

<p>Now lift the house carefully, place it right side up on the
ground, and adjust the chimney to the roof.   As you work
keep the picture of the
house in front of you so
that you may see at a
glance whether you are
building it correctly or
not. If you cannot find
large burrs, let the sides
and the roof of the house
be two layers of burrs
stuck firmly together.
Make a path leading up
to the door of very small
shells, sand, or fresh earth.</p>

<h3>Pond, with Water-Lilies,
in the Garden</h3>

<p>Would you like to have
a little pond near the
house, with white water-lilies floating on its surface and wee
cattails growing here and there in and near the water's edge?</p>
<div class="center">

<p>You can easily make such a pond. Sink a shallow pan
in the ground, a hole must be dug to fit it, you know, and
fill the pan with water. Cover the edges with moss or earth
and plant short-stemmed heads of timothy-grass (<a href="#Fig_131">Fig. 131</a>)
and slender, stiff grass-blades in scattered groups near
the water. It is timothy-grass that looks so much like
cattails, and also the grass called foxtail.</p>

<p>Some of the cattails can be made to look as if they were

burrs around the ends of the stems to hold them upright
(<a href="#Fig_132">Fig. 132</a>), and put some small stones on top of the ball
to weight it down in the water.</p>

any rather small, smooth, round leaves. The marsh-marigold
leaf will answer, or you can cut out water-lily leaves

<p>When you make the canoe, open the pod where you see

little braces of broom-straws, and put them in crosswise

four braces in the canoe (<a href="#Fig_135">Fig. 135</a>), but you may not need

<h3>The Trees</h3>

<p>In the picture given here the tree on the left of the little
house of burrs is just two stalks of the common grass called
meadow muhlenbergia, which are held up as if really growing,
by several green burrs left from building the house.
The burrs are squeezed up tight to the grass-stems and
then pressed down tight to the ground. You can find the
grass for these trees almost any place; it is very social and
loves to make its home with other grasses.</p>

<p>The graceful, drooping tree on the right of the house
is made of the grass called brome-grass. Keep your eyes
open and you will find it some time while playing out-of-doors.
As soon as you see it, run to the brome-grass and
whisper its name. You will be glad to discover it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
will remember its name afterward whenever you see the
grass.</p>

<p>Look at the picture again and notice the odd plants near
the brome-grass tree. Their name is Bermuda-grass. See
how they spread out their long, slender fingers. They look
very much like a grass named the small crab-grass, and
another the large crab-grass,
and like another still called
the wire-grass; but if you put
all these side by side and examine
them closely you will
see how they differ.</p>


<h3>Burdock-Burr Game</h3>

<div class="caption">Fig.138 - Hold the burr this way
when you throw it at the
target.</div>
</div>
<p>Besides making things of
burdock-burrs, you can play
a game with them. The game
is something like archery,
only, instead of shooting arrows
at a target, you throw
burrs at it.</p>

<p>Get a good-sized piece of
woollen cloth or some kind
of material with a rough surface
to which the burrs will
cling. Tack this up on the
fence or on a board; then,
with a large piece of chalk
that will make a wide mark,
draw four circles, one inside the other like <a href="#Fig_137">Fig. 137</a>. It
doesn't matter if your circles are not perfect. Do the
best you can and finish your target. Number the spaces
between the circles 1, 2, 3, 10. The outer space is 1, the
next, 2, next to the centre 3, and the centre 10. The centre,
being the bull's-eye, counts most.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Have ready a lot of burrs for each player; mark a
boundary-line on the ground, beyond which no one must
step in throwing the burrs, and, standing at the boundary-line,
let each player in turn throw three burrs at the target.
The burrs that stick to the target make the score if they
are in the numbered spaces. <a href="#Fig_138">Fig. 138</a> shows how to hold
the burr. Suppose one burr sticks to the space numbered
2, and the two others are in number 1, the player would
then have two ones and one two which, added together,
make four; her score then would be four.</p>

<p>Always pull the burrs of one player off the target before
the next player takes her turn, and there will be no question
as to who should claim them. After each player has
had three turns, let every one add up her scores. The
player who has the highest wins the game. If divided
into sides, the players on the side having the highest score
are the winners and they should be given a hearty cheer
by the losing side. Even very little girls and boys should
learn to be good losers and to help celebrate the victory
of others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<small>THINGS TO MAKE OF ENGLISH-WALNUT SHELLS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Nuts</span> are the seed-vessels of the nut-trees; did you ever
think of that? They do not grow only that we may have
something delicious to eat. They ripen and fall on the
ground, where some of them take root and grow up into
trees themselves. If you plant a hickory-nut a little
hickory-tree should come up, and it will if the conditions
are all right. If you plant a walnut it will be a walnut-tree
that will appear; so you see a nutshell is the seed-vessel
of the nut-tree.</p>

<p>English walnuts do not grow wild in this country, but
are cultivated here and you all know what the English
walnut is like. Our American walnut is very hard to crack;
its shell is rough and deeply grooved, but the English-walnut
shell is smooth and without sharp edges, though its
surface is uneven. There is a shallow groove running round
the shell, like a seam, and the shell cracks open along this
seam evenly and easily.</p>


<h3>To Open an English Walnut</h3>

<p>The easiest way to open an English walnut so that
the shell will be in two perfect halves is to push the tip
of a penknife-blade into the groove at the large end of
the nut, and then slowly and carefully turn the knife to
pry the halves apart. When opened this way the shell
is never broken (<a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">

<img src="images/i_128.png" width="427" height="409" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.139 - This is the way to open the shell.</div>
</div>

<p>After you have opened several nuts and taken out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
kernels, use the knife to cut away the thin, papery divisions
inside the shells.   You will then be ready to make</p>


<h3>The Professor</h3>

<div class='unindent'>and one half-shell is to be his head. Draw a face on the
shell like the face of the professor (<a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>). The narrow
part of the shell is his chin, the wide part, the top of his
head. He has an intellectual forehead, high and broad,
with furrows of thought showing plainly on it.</div>

<div class="caption">Fig.140 - The English Walnutshell Professor.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Professor's Robe</h3>

<p>As a rule professors wear black robes when they wear
any, but our nutshell professor wears white because it is
more becoming to his dark complexion, and because it
is more effective and draws attention to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 431px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>To make the robe, fold an oblong piece of white paper
into a square, which makes the square double. The edges
should measure about four inches. If you have a large
white envelope cut off one end to make it square and use
that. Fold the square diagonally across from point to
point, as is shown by the dotted
line in <a href="#Fig_141">Fig. 141</a>. Now turn
back first one side point, then
the other side point, and make
them meet over the first fold to
form a fanlike pleat, wider at
the bottom than at the top.
The dotted lines on either side of the middle one in <a href="#Fig_141">Fig.
141</a> show where the folds should come. The middle fold
is bent out, or toward you; the side folds are bent in, or
away from you. The side points now extending toward
you are the wide, flowing sleeves of the professor's gown.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.143 - Ear for the mouse.</div>
</div>
<p>Take the robe in your hand at the bottom point, holding
it from the back, and on the top point hang the professor's
nutshell head (<a href="#Fig_140">Fig. 140</a>).</p>

<p>While the head balances quite securely on the point,
you can make it wag from side to side, make it shake and
tremble when the professor grows very earnest in his discourse,
and make the chin thrust itself forward when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
is emphatic. You do all this merely by shaking and tipping
the paper robe. He is an amusing little lecturer, this
English-walnut shell professor, and seems very much alive.</p>


<h3>English-Walnut Shell Mouse</h3>

<p>It is a far cry from a lecturer to a little mouse, yet one
English-walnut shell will make both, half a shell for each.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">

</div>
<p>This is a nice, cosey-looking little
mouse who crouches down comfortably
and does not show his
legs (<a href="#Fig_142">Fig. 142</a>).</p>

<p>The point of the shell is the
nose of the mouse; above it make
two round, black eyes and then
paste on two brown-paper ears.
Cut the ears like <a href="#Fig_143">Fig. 143</a>, bend
back the little stems at the bottom,
put a touch of paste on each stem and stick the
ears to the mouse's head in the position shown in <a href="#Fig_142">Fig.
142</a>. Cut a piece of string about three inches long for
the tail and paste one end of it on the inside edge of the
shell at the large end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>If you make three of these mice and glue them to a piece
of cardboard they will look very cunning. Or you can
glue one mouse to a small card and use it for the top of a
Christmas pen-wiper.</p>


<h3>English-Walnut Shell Thimble-Box</h3>

<p>A pretty way to give a small present at Christmas or
on a birthday is to put it into an English-walnut shell box.
A thimble fits in the box beautifully (see <a href="#Fig_144">Fig. 144</a>).</p>

<p>Open the shell of an English walnut in the way described
(<a href="#Fig_139">Fig. 139</a>). Cut away the inside partitions and, with jeweller's
cotton, make a soft little bed in one-half of the shell.
Press down the cotton in the middle to make a hollow, and
in this hollow fit the new thimble. Put a layer of cotton
over the top of the thimble and tuck in the edges. The
way to close the box is to cover the edges of the other half-shell
with glue and then fit it on the half that holds the
thimble, just as it was before you opened it.</p>

<p>Now you have a whole nut again, but the meat inside
is very different from that which you took out. You can
gild the nutshell after the glue has hardened or leave it
as it is. Its own brown color is pretty enough. In either
case you must have a piece of narrow ribbon to tie around
the box and form a loop by which to hang it (<a href="#Fig_145">Fig. 145</a>).</p>

<p>Pass the ribbon under the small end of the nutshell, then
bring it up and tie it securely at the top of the large end.
The ribbon should not be over the seam but should pass
across the middle of each half-shell. It will then hold the
two parts together and keep the glue from loosening. After
the ribbon is tied at the top of the nut, make a long loop
above it and tie again in a bow-knot.</p>

<h3>Swimming Fish Made of a Lima-Bean Pod</h3>

<p>A fish that really swims, not on top of the water but in
it, is the little fish (<a href="#Fig_146">Fig. 146</a>). You won't find that in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>

to make it myself.</p>

</div>

<p>A paper tail and two paper fins must be added, but that
won't take five minutes when you know how to do it. The
tail and fins make it wonderfully
lifelike, for when the fish swims
around in a big basin or dish-pan,
the tail sways this way and that,
the fins move back and forth exactly
as they do on a living fish
in a real lake or in the great ocean.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.150 - The Lima Bean Man will stand.</div>
</div>
<p>Choose a good, firm bean-pod,
one as flat and even as you can
find, open it carefully along the straight edge and take
out the beans. Save the beans, for you can make something
of them too. Do not let the pod close again after
the beans are out.   It must be open about half an inch,
or maybe a little more, at the middle. You can widen
the opening by pushing your finger in.   Be careful not to
split it along the upper edge.   It should be like <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>,
which shows the opening at the bottom.</p>

<p>With the small blade of a pocket-knife make a slit on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
each side of the pod at the large end where it is marked
C in <a href="#Fig_147">Fig. 147</a>.</p>



<p>These slits are to hold the fins. Directly on the curved
edge of the small end of the pod, at the place marked D,
cut another short slit. Don't let it reach the lower edge.
This is to hold the tail.</p>

<p>From writing-paper, not the very heavy kind, cut two
fins like <a href="#Fig_148">Fig. 148</a>. Double the paper and cut out both at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
once so that they may be exactly alike. From the same
kind of paper cut the tail like <a href="#Fig_149">Fig. 149</a>. All you have to
do now is to push the sharp point of one paper fin into the
slit on one side of the pod, the other fin into the slit on the
other side of the pod, and the sharp point of the tail into
the slit in the edge of the pod, and there is your fish. You
see the fins and tail are not pasted on and they really seem
a living part of the fish. Notice that the top of fins and
tail are different from the bottom, and be sure to have the
top edge up when you put them in the slits.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.151 - Parts of Lima Bean Man</div>
</div>

<p>The way to make the lima-bean fish swim is to place
it, open edge down, in a large basin of water; then with
a stick or spoon begin at the centre to stir the water gently
and gradually round and round until it all moves faster
and faster, and keeps on moving after you stop stirring.
Then your little green fish will swim.   Round and round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the basin he will go, his tail waving and his fins moving
so naturally you will shout with delight.</p>

<p>If at first the fish insists upon turning over on his side
and floating about like a dead fish, don't give him up. He
is only playing 'possum. He <i>can</i> swim and he <i>will</i> if you
are patient and keep setting him upright until he gains his
balance and becomes used to the water. Remember to put
the fish <i>in</i> the water, not on top.</p>

<p>Don't let the beans, that you have taken out of the pod
when making the fish, get dry and hard. They can
be turned into a</p>


<h3>Lima-Bean Man</h3>

<p>Three beans and several strong, straight broom-straws
you will need for making this comical little fellow, who,
upright and independent, stands squarely on his own feet.
That is a good thing for any one to do, let alone a little
bean man (<a href="#Fig_150">Fig. 150</a>).</p>

<p>The beans should be of different sizes. A large one for
the body, next in size for the feet and a smaller one for
the head. Some beans have a little point that stands out
on one edge and looks like a tiny nose, while below it there
is a round hollow that looks like a little open mouth. That
is the kind of bean to choose for the little man's head.</p>

<p>The broom-straw for Mr. Bean's arms should be quite
four inches long, if he is to be four inches tall. Cut one
end of this broom-straw slanting to a point like E in <a href="#Fig_151">Fig.
151</a>, and push the point through the upper part of the body
bean and out far enough on the other side to make the
arms of equal length; then bend one arm up at the middle
where the elbow should be, and the other arm down as
you see them in the drawing of the man (<a href="#Fig_150">Fig. 150</a>).</p>

<p>The broom-straws for the legs must be two and a half
inches long and cut pointed at both ends, for one end of
the leg is pushed into the lower part of the body bean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the other end into the half bean which is the foot. Split
the foot bean in half to make two feet and push the leg
straw into the rounded side. The flat side is the bottom
of the foot.</p>

<p>A short piece of broom-straw, hardly an inch long, is
the neck. Cut this straw pointed at each end, push one
end into the top of the body bean and the other end into
the lower part of the head bean. Use one-half of the outer
skin, that comes off the foot bean when you split it, for
a hat. Being curved like a rose-petal, it fits the head very
nicely, but a drop of paste on the little man's head will
make it more secure.</p>

<p>Look over all your bean-pods that still have beans in
them, and select the one shaped most like <a href="#Fig_153">Fig. 153</a>. Do
not take the beans out of the pod; they make the pig fat
and solid.   The stem end forms the snout and the head.</p>

push the pointed end into the lower part of the body, two on
each side, in the places shown by small rings on <a href="#Fig_153">Fig. 153</a>.</p>

<p>From part of another

like F, <a href="#Fig_154">Fig. 154</a>, and pin
them on the pig's head
with a short straw as

through the head and
then through the other

the head.</p>

point of the scissors in the upper edge of the pig's back
at the place marked by the arrow on <a href="#Fig_153">Fig. 153</a>, and push
one end of the tail into the hole. Make small round dots
with a pencil, or pen and ink, for the eyes. The ears and
tail may be made of paper if you find that easier to use.</p>

alligator from which the drawing was made is the size of
the live ones; the drawing is, of course, smaller.</p>

<h3>What to Make of a Radish</h3>

<p>A crisp, fresh, clean radish is very tempting, but don't
eat it this time; turn it into something
else by the magic your ten
fingers can work.</p>


<h3>The Radish Imp</h3>

<p><a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a> shows a round white
radish which, with its long, slender
root and leaves still on it, has been
changed into a queer little radish
imp by using strong broom-straws
to stiffen his leaf arms, his leaf legs,
and his leaf body. His eyes are bits
of broom-straw, his mouth is a slit
with a broom-straw tongue, and his
absurd, stand-out ears are also pieces
of stout broom-straw.</p>

<p>The root growing out of the top
of his head is like a Chinaman's
queue standing on end with little,
crinkly separate hairs at its base.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 205px;">
<a id="Fig_161"></a>
<img src="images/i_143.png" width="205" height="486" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.161 - Cut two broom-straws
for the arms and
two for the legs.</div>
</div>

<p>When you make your radish imp
cut two broom-straws about four
inches long for his arms; point these at the ends. Cut
two more strong broom-straws a little longer than the
distance between the radish and the tips of the two longest
leaves. Point these at both ends (<a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>). Now
choose two leaves of even length, nearest the radish, for
the arms. Don't take them off but push a broom-straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
through each leaf, first in, then out, then push the other
end of the straw into the thick part of the stems just under
the radish. Look at <a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a> and see how this is done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 434px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.163 - These belong to the mouse.</div>
</div>

<p>The leaves with the longest stems must be used for the
legs.   If there are more than two long-stemmed leaves,
cut off all except those wanted for the legs. Bend the long,
stout broom-straws at one end, as in <a href="#Fig_161">Fig. 161</a>, and push
the other end up through the thick part of the stems and
into the radish; then with a piece of string or strong blade
of grass tie the stems of the leaves to the straws, as shown
in <a href="#Fig_160">Fig. 160</a>. This forms a little belt at the waist-line. Leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a large leaf with short stem loose at the back for a cape
and run the bent ends of the long straws in and out of the
leaves intended for the feet.</p>

<p>Cut a curved slit in the radish for a mouth and push
in a small piece of broom-straw for a tongue, then put in
bits of straw for eyes, nose, and uplifted ears.</p>


<h3>A White Mouse</h3>

<p>You can make a most amusing little white mouse of a
white radish; not a round one like that used for the imp,
but egg-shaped, like <a href="#Fig_162">Fig. 162</a>. The long root is the tail
of the mouse and the other end of the radish is his head.
Cut two paper ears like H, <a href="#Fig_163">Fig. 163</a>. Make two slits in the
head and slip the pointed ends of the ears into the slits.</p>

<p>For whiskers (all mice have whiskers) find two sprays
of fine branching broom-straws (I, <a href="#Fig_163">Fig. 163</a>), cut them
the proper length, and push a spray into the head on each
side of the nose. Put bits of broom-straw in for eyes and
then cut four thick straws like J, <a href="#Fig_163">Fig. 163</a>, and push the
pointed ends slantingly in the lower part of the radish for
the feet of the mouse. His legs are not seen because he
is crouching. The drawing of the mouse shows where to
put the feet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<small>GREEN-PEA TOYS AND A GREEN-PEA DESIGN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Press</span> your thumb on the rounded edge of a fresh, fat
green pea-pod, and, pop! it goes splitting open at the top.
Then push your thumb into the opening, run it down the
pod and the two halves separate, showing a row of fine,
large peas that look like great green pearls in a soft, silk-lined
case made expressly for them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 561px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.164 - The Green Pea Greenies, cousins of the Brownies.</div>
</div>

<p>You have done this ever so many times when helping
mother, haven't you? And you know that the next thing
to do when the pod is open is to run that same little thumb
down again and scoop out all those round green peas, letting
them fall with a patter into the pan in your lap.</p>

<p>Now as a reward for such helpfulness suppose you ask
mother or the cook to give you a good big handful of
peas which have not been shelled, and ask also for some
wooden toothpicks such as are used in the kitchen for fastening
meat together; or a number of nice, straight, strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
broom-straws if there are no wooden toothpicks. Take all
these out on the porch if the day is fine and sit down comfortably
to make the remarkable things which I am going
to tell you how to make. It is a good plan to have a box
and its cover to hold the shelled peas and their pods, but
it does not really matter except that the round peas are
apt to roll away and get lost if you put them in your lap.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 557px;">

<div class="caption">Fig.165 - Parts of the Greeny Girl and how to put them together.</div>
</div>


<h3>The Greeny Girl</h3>

<p>The little green-pea greenies, cousins of the brownies,
shown in the illustration are funny, aren't they? But
the drawing is not as funny as the real greenies, and you
can make them in all sorts of absurd positions.</p>

<p>Two little men and a widely smiling greeny girl are given
here (<a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>). The large green peas that come late in
the season are used to make these little people. In fact,
it is only the large peas that can be used for any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
things described. <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a> shows how the greeny girl is
put together. Her arms, legs, and neck are made of broom-straws.
Her body and head are green peas. Her dress is
one end of a pea-pod and her feet are bits of a pea-pod cut
the shape you see in <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a>.</p>

<p>First cut short pieces of broom-straws for the legs and
point them at both ends so that they will be easy to push
into the peas and pods. Cut another piece the same length,
pointed at the top end for the support. Push the legs and
support into the large pea used for the body as you see
them in <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a>. Now cut another piece of broom-straw
pointed at both ends for the neck and push one end into
the pea you have selected for the head.</p>

</table></div>




<p>Cut off the stem of a large pea-pod, leaving the little
leaves at the top, which were the calyx of the pea-blossom,
for a collar, and then cut the pea-pod dress the proper length
to fit the little woman. When that is done put the dress
on over the headless body and push the lower end of the
broom-straw neck in at the top, down through the collar,
and into the pea which forms the body. With a pin make
a hole on each side just under the collar and push a broom-straw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
arm in each of the armholes you have made. Bend
one straw in the middle, as in <a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a>, to give the bent
elbow.</p>

<p>Last of all cut two three-cornered feet like the one in
<a href="#Fig_165">Fig. 165</a> from a pea-pod and push a foot on the end of each
leg. Turn the toes in and the little figure will look very
comical. To give her a face, dip a pen in black ink and
make two round eyes in the head, a round nose, and a wide
mouth turned up at the corners. The pen must be pushed
through the skin of the pea to do this. When the greeny
girl stands up, her dress hides the support at the back so
that it cannot always be seen, and she looks as if she stood
on her two feet just as you stand on yours.</p>


<h3>The Greeny Men</h3>

<p>The illustration (<a href="#Fig_164">Fig. 164</a>) shows how the greeny men
are put together. The little dancing fellow must have
two supports because one foot is lifted. The tiny ridiculous
cap on the head of the other man is the little cap that
holds the pea to the pod and sometimes clings to the pea
after it is shelled.</p>


<h3>Pea-Pod Tents</h3>

<p>The greenies' little tents are made of pea-pods and it
takes three pods for each tent. After you have taken out
the peas split the pods up along the back edge, but leave
the two halves fastened together at the stem. Stand up
two pods by pushing the stem end of one pod between the
two halves at the top of the other, as they are shown in
<a href="#Fig_166">Fig. 166</a>. Then separate the halves of the third and longest
pod and place it astride the first two (<a href="#Fig_167">Fig. 167</a>). This will
make quite a strong tent, and, if you like, you can have
a whole camp of them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Green-Pea House</h3>

<p>The greenies need not always live in tents. Like other
people, they can have houses as well.</p>

<p>It is best to use the wooden toothpicks in making the
house. They are stronger than broom-straws and all the
same length. Begin by putting the front of the house together.
Make the peak first. Choose a large pea, push
the end of a toothpick into it, then not far from that push
in the end of another toothpick slantingly so that the lower
ends will be separated as you see them in <a href="#Fig_168">Fig. 168</a>. On
each of these lower ends stick a pea like <a href="#Fig_169">Fig. 169</a>. That
is the peak for the roof. Now make a long upright for
each side by using a pea to join two sticks (<a href="#Fig_170">Fig. 170</a>), and
push the upper end of each upright into the peas at the
lower ends of the peak (<a href="#Fig_171">Fig. 171</a>).</p>

<p>Shorten two toothpicks by breaking half an inch off
each of them, then join them as you did the uprights by
pushing one end of each stick into a large pea (<a href="#Fig_172">Fig. 172</a>).
This is the front joist or crosspiece of the upper floor
of the house, and you must fit it in between the two uprights
of the front by pushing the ends of the crosspiece
into the peas at the middle of the uprights (<a href="#Fig_173">Fig. 173</a>).</p>

<p>The back of the house is made in the same way with a

from the point of the peak to the bottom of the house.
This third upright is made by shortening two toothpicks
and joining them with a pea, then fitting them in between
the pea at the top of the peak and the pea at the middle
of the crosspiece. A whole toothpick with the upper end
pushed into the lower part of the pea at the middle of the
crosspiece finishes the long upright (<a href="#Fig_174">Fig. 174</a>).</p>

<a href="#Fig_175">Fig. 175</a>), one on each side between the peas at the bottom
of the peaks (L and M), one at each side between the peas
at the ends of the front and back
crosspieces (N, O), and one between
the two peas at the middle of
the front and back crosspieces (P).</p>

<p>Now you have the frame of a
two-storied house or a house
with only an upper story, but
it needs a roof and a floor.
Split some of your pea-pods in
half and lay one at a time
across the ridge-pole at the
top and the crosspiece at the
bottom of the peak. Put half
of a pod on one side of the
peak, half a pod on the other
side of the peak, then another
half pod on the first side, and
the next one on the second
side, and so on until the space
is covered and the house is
roofed in. The stem ends of
the pods must be up.   The
stems lock together and hold the
roof in place.</p>

<p>Make the loosely laid floor also
of the split pea-pods, putting them
across from front to back.</p>


<p>Your little house (<a href="#Fig_176">Fig. 176</a>) now
looks like those which strange
people in far-away, hot countries
build for themselves.   They have
no lower story or what we call a first floor, but are lifted
on posts far above the sometimes very damp ground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and out of reach of any wild animals that may be prowling
around.</p>


<h3>The Fence</h3>

<p>You can make a fence to put around the house in this
way: Push a large pea on each end of a whole toothpick
like <a href="#Fig_177">Fig. 177</a>, then break a toothpick
exactly in half, stick one
end of each half into the lower
parts of the peas to form uprights,
and push the lower end
of each of these uprights into
another pea as shown in <a href="#Fig_178">Fig. 178</a>.
For the slanting crosspiece stick
one end of another toothpick into
the upper pea at the left-hand side, and the other end
into the lower pea at the right-hand side (<a href="#Fig_179">Fig. 179</a>). Add
a toothpick between the two lower peas, and one section of
the fence is finished
(<a href="#Fig_180">Fig. 180</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 242px;">

other end into
the upper pea at
the left side of
the section you
have just finished (<a href="#Fig_180">Fig. 180</a>), then put in half a toothpick
for the upright, a pea on the bottom of that, a whole
toothpick for the slanting crosspiece, and another whole
toothpick for the bottom.</p>

<p>In this way you can keep on adding section after section
and make your fence any length.   To turn a corner all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
you have to do is to push the toothpicks which form the

back of the top and bottom peas of an end section of the

<h3>The Tropical Plant</h3>

<p>You will notice that in the illustration there is a plant
growing at the side of the house which looks something
like a cactus and adds to the tropical, or hot-country look
of the little greeny people's home.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.182 - The Green Pea design.</div>
</div>

<p>Seven half pea-pods are used to make this plant, four
to stand up and three to lie down flat. Wrap and tie the
stem ends of the four half pods together with a bit of string.
Push a toothpick for a flower-stem through the middle
of the bunch. Cut away the stem of a pea-pod, then cut
off the calyx, or circle of little leaves, with the knob below
attached. This is to be the blossom of the strange plant.
Stick the flower on its toothpick stem, knob down, as you
see it in the picture.</p>

<p>To make the plant stand firmly lay the three extra half
pods down flat with the stem ends one on top of the other
and the outer ends at equal distances apart, and force
the toothpick flower-stem through the pods where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
cross. These three flat pods make a base which holds the
rest of the plant upright, while they look as if they were
a part of it.</p>


<h3>A Pretty Design of Green Peas</h3>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<a id="Fig_183"></a>
<img src="images/i_156.png" width="262" height="279" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.183 - Do not open the pods wide.</div>
</div>
<p>This is not a toy, but you will like to make it just the
same, and afterward, perhaps, you will want to try another
design all by yourself. If you can draw at all, with
a soft pencil make some
curves on a piece of white
paper like <a href="#Fig_181">Fig. 181</a>, only
ever so much larger, then
a straight line up from the
centre. The distance
between the two largest
curves at their widest
part should be about eight
inches. If you cannot
draw these curves, ask
some older person to do
it for you.</p>

<p>Lay your paper with
the pattern drawn on it flat on the table before you, shell
some peas and carefully place them on the pencil lines of
the curves. Begin with the largest peas at the centre of
the design and finish with the smallest at the ends of the
curves. <a href="#Fig_182">Fig. 182</a> shows how this is done. Put the first
pea on the curve at the place shown by the arrow in
<a href="#Fig_181">Fig. 181</a>.</p>

<p>You won't be able to keep the peas in place unless you
stick them to the paper with paste. Hold the tube of paste
in your left hand, squeeze out a very little, take it off the
tube with one of the peas and push the pea, paste side
down, onto the paper where it belongs.</p>

<p>When the peas are all placed on the curves open two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
pea-pods as you did for the greenies' tent, slide one pod
between the two halves of the other, and with a little paste
on the stem ends and the tips, fasten them in the middle
above the curves of peas as they are shown in <a href="#Fig_182">Fig. 182</a>.
The two halves of each pod are not opened wide but are
like <a href="#Fig_183">Fig. 183</a>. Above the pods, on the straight, upright
line, place four more peas, beginning at the bottom with
a large pea and ending with one much smaller.</p>

<p>The success of this design will depend upon making one
side just like the other and in keeping it equally balanced.
That is, one side must not sag down below the other and
the pods at the top must fit exactly on the line, half on
one side, half on the other.</p>

<p>The peas, you see, do not touch each other, but are
separated by little spaces, and the spaces are all of the same
length.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<small>CORN-HUSKS AND CORN-COBS</small></h2>


<h3>How to Make American History Seem Real&mdash;Our First
Thanksgiving</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us play that we are really celebrating America's
first Thanksgiving!</p>

<p>You can see one of our long, rude puncheon tables spread
out in the mild, sweet air of Indian summer, laden with
delectable dishes of clam chowder, oysters, fish, turkey,
duck, goose, venison pasties, turnips, dumplings of barley
flour, corn bread, wheat cakes, pumpkin pies, grapes, plums,
great flagons of cider, and "all manner of tasty eats."</p>

<p>William Bradford, our good governor, with his old flintlock
in hand, is just returning from a successful hunt for
additional wild turkey. We shall need these, as ninety
friendly Indians are to be our guests for three days and
nights. Later they, too, will hunt and bring us wild deer.</p>

<p>Elder Brewster, in his festive doublet and hose, has
stopped a moment to speak to Master Bradford. Sitting
at table, you can see Captain Miles Standish with arms
outstretched in glad welcome as he calls more Indians to
join the feast, while Massasoit, the mighty chief, stands
at the table signalling with his arrow for the braves to approach.</p>

<p>Already Quadquina and Hobomok are at the festive
board, seated between Captain Miles Standish and John
Alden. Squanto, who tells the boys how to trap game and
teaches settlers how to plant corn, is resting on the ground
with his feather-bedecked shield in one hand, and the
calumet, or pipe of peace, in the other.</p>

<p>Now winsome Priscilla Alden comes, bearing on a pewter
platter one of her savory hot baked turkeys, and her friend,
Mary Chilton, is watching the delicious stew which simmers
in the big iron pot over the outdoor fire.</p>

<p>Mistress Brewster, on her way to cut pumpkin pie, must
needs stay her steps a moment to give ear to Governor
Bradford's remarks, and Desire Minter is hurrying forward,
ahead of the other young women, to serve the men at the
feast.</p>

<p>All this would be told you by one of the little corn-husk
pioneers shown in the photograph if
only they could speak.</p>



<p>At all events, they can stand alone.
They can be made to sit down, too,
and their arms can be bent in any
position. You may lift and place
them in various parts of the grounds
at pleasure. You might even imagine
them to be the real characters
they represent, and so live over again
that Thanksgiving of 1621.</p>

<p>The making of these little people
is most interesting. Use the rather
soft between-layers of corn-husks; about two husks for
each pioneer.   If the husks seem brittle, soak them in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
water and make them pliable. Lay one husk partially
over the top of the other (<a href="#Fig_184">Fig. 184</a>), bend them across
the centre (<a href="#Fig_185">Fig. 185</a>), and let the smoothest side be the
front of the doll. Fold each side of the front to the back
until the front somewhat resembles <a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>; then wind
slender, soft string around to form the neck and head of
the doll. Wind another soft string around lower down
for the belt-line (<a href="#Fig_187">Fig. 187</a>).</p>

the lengthwise edges of the husk inward again and again,
until the roll is of the desired size. Cut off the ends evenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and wind the arms with string at the centre and near each

of the doll from side to side. Turn the blade flat side uppermost
and allow it to remain in this position while you
slide in the arms and screw them through the opening,
pushing them along on top of the flat side of the blade.
When in place, withdraw the knife and your little woman
will be ready for her costume.</p>

<p>Cut the coat from a folded
piece of dull-green tissue-paper,
and just at the neck
make a hole large enough for
the man's head to slip through
(<a href="#Fig_191">Fig. 191</a>). Paste the front
edges of the sleeves over the back edges and lay the front
edges of the coat over those of the back. Fit the coat in at
the belt-line with your fingers. Cut a black belt of tissue-paper,
fold it lengthwise, and belt in the fulness of the coat,
then paste the belt ends together.   Be careful to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the belt loose, for men's waists are large. Make the collar
(<a href="#Fig_192">Fig. 192</a>) of white paper and fasten it around the man's
neck with a drop of paste in front.</p>

<p>From black, brown, or drab-yellow tissue-paper cut a
strip of fine fringe and paste it on the man's head for hair
(<a href="#Fig_193">Fig. 193</a>). Then
make his hat. To
do this, roll a small
square of stiff black
paper into a cornucopia
to fit the man's
head, paste the edges
together, and trim off
the corner which
hangs down at the
bottom (<a href="#Fig_194">Fig. 194</a>).
Glue the hat-crown
on the man's head,
cut off the sharp top
peak, and tilt the
crown back a little
(<a href="#Fig_195">Fig. 195</a>).</p>

<p>Now cut a disk of
the black paper for
the hat-brim, slash it
across the centre into
four points (<a href="#Fig_196">Fig. 196</a>),
but only just far enough to make the opening fit over the
hat-crown. Slide the brim on the crown, allowing the
slashed central points to lie up against it, and fasten them
there with paste (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>). Glue the pioneer's feet into
holes cut part-way through a small piece of the corrugated
flat pasteboard used for packing purposes. In this
way the little man becomes independent and able to stand
alone (<a href="#Fig_197">Fig. 197</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>The corn-husk women also wear tissue-paper clothes.
The waists are made in the same manner as the men's
coats, only shorter and confined at the belt-line with paste.
Straight dress skirts are slipped over the waists, and held
in place at the belt by winding string around the pinched-up
gathers. Long, severely plain white aprons, minus
strings, are pasted to the waist-line, and white-bordered
black caps and large white three-cornered neckerchiefs
complete the costume.</p>

<p>The cap is a straight piece of black tissue-paper with a
narrow strip of white folded over the front edge. When
ready, the white-bordered black strip is laid over the head,
smoothly brought down on the sides, puckered together
at the back and tied around the neck with a string. You
have only to clip loose the outside layer of white close to
the string at the neck-line to give the flare to the cap's white
border.</p>

<p>The crisp dress skirt forms sufficient support to enable
the little women to stand alone.</p>

<p>With the exception of Squanto, whose manly chest,
back, and arms have no covering, the Indians wear suits
of tan tissue-paper made on the same principle as the white
men's costume, only the trouser-legs are narrow, long, and
have the seam cut in fringe and run up on the outside. The
bottom edge of the coat and the sleeve seams are also
fringed. The coat is not wide and no belt is worn.</p>

<p>Pieces of colored tissue-paper adjusted blanket fashion
over the Indians, and fastened here and there with bits
of paste to hold them in place, form the Indian blankets.</p>

<p>The Indians' hair is merely a strip of black tissue-paper
pasted over the top, back, and sides of the head with the
ends loosely twisted and allowed to hang down in front on
either side.</p>

the strip is then pasted around Massasoit's head, as shown
in the picture.</p>

<p>It is best to make a number of corn-husk people at one
time. Put the two husks together for each pioneer and
Indian, then wind a string around the neck of each to form
the head (<a href="#Fig_186">Fig. 186</a>). Again tie a string around each at the
belt-line (<a href="#Fig_187">Fig. 187</a>). Continue making the people in this
way, step by step, until all are finished at the same time.
Have ready as many arms as you have people, and run the
arms through each, one after another.</p>

<p>When bending the arms or legs of the little people do
it slowly and gently. If they are inclined to spring back,
tie them in position overnight and they will stay bent.</p>

<p>When dressing the dolls, cut out all the men's collars
at one time. You can do this by cutting through as many
layers of paper as there are men. Adopt the same plan
with the other parts of clothing for the men, women, and
Indians, and your work will be rapid.</p>

<p>With ink draw features on all. The women must have
ink hair, parted in the middle.</p>

<p>Remember when making Miles Standish to cut his hair
of red paper, for he had auburn hair.</p>

<p>The "sad" colors worn by the pioneers were really the
cheerful autumn hues, rich, dull reds, greens, browns, and
yellows. These will give you quite a variety of colors for
the costumes of both men and women.</p>

<p>Make the puncheon table of a flat, narrow piece of wood.
With a gimlet bore holes through the board, slanting them
toward the centre, one hole near each corner. Any kind of
round sticks will do for the legs. Cut them all of the same
length and glue one in each hole.</p>

<p>The pewter dishes are made from one of the collapsible
lead tubes used for oil-paints and various other things.
Cut open the empty tube and smooth it out flat, then cut
out round pieces for plates, mould the plates over the tops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a><br /><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
of wooden spools, and the flagons over a pen-handle or
other round stick. Make the flagon-handles of slender
strips of the tube bent into rings, and slip one end of the
strip over the edge of the flagon.</p>

<p>A piece of yellow paper pasted over the cover of a very
small baking-powder can makes a pumpkin pie. The
turkey is merely pinched-up paper with brown tissue-paper
laid smoothly over the breast.   Its wings and legs
are of bits of lighter-colored paper rolled and bent into
shape, then pasted on the turkey.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.198 - Corn-cob log for pioneer log cabin with notches
cut and marked.</div>
</div>

<p>Fresh, green, uncooked corn-cobs from which the corn
has been cut and scraped make delightful pioneer log-houses.
Cooked cobs are too hard to cut. Choose slender
cobs, long ones for the front and back of the house, shorter
ones for the sides. Cut a notch, or saw it, if the cobs are
dry and hard, on the tops of the ends of each of the two
foundation logs (<a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>). Cut a notch on both top and
bottom of each remaining log as indicated by the black
lines in <a href="#Fig_198">Fig. 198</a>.</p>

<p>Always make a larger notch in the small end of the cob
than in the large end, so that the large end of another cob
may fit in it; for, when building, it is necessary to place
small ends and large ends together, and never two large
ends or two small ends, or the house will be unevenly balanced.</p>

<p>Lay the two foundation cobs down parallel to each other
and a short distance apart; then bridge across the ends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
with shorter cobs, fitting the notches into each other. Continue
building in this log-cabin fashion until the house is
of sufficient height.</p>

<p>On the front of the house draw two straight lines down
across the cobs, one for each side of the doorway. Then
take your house apart and cut the doorway out from the
marked cobs. Rebuild the house, gluing layer upon layer.
Make the doorway jambs of straight pieces of corn-stalk,
and glue them on each side of the open doorway.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 460px;">
<img src="images/i_171.jpg" width="460" height="412" alt="photograph" />
<div class="caption">Pioneer log cabin made of corn-cobs.</div>
</div>

<p>Before the roof can be added, corn-cobs, graduated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
length and without notches, must be laid at each end of
the house to support the roof and give it its gable ends.
These graduated cobs are the "trap-logs." They rest
upon long strips of corn-stalk, called "ribs," which are
placed across from one end of the house to the other.
Build the roof log-cabin fashion as you built the body of
the house, laying a rib between the ends of each layer of
graduated cobs, and as you build, fasten the parts together
with glue.</p>

<p>Cut enough clapboards of corn-stalk to cover both sides
of the roof. Make them all of the same length and long
enough to reach from the top of the roof to a trifle beyond
its lower edge.</p>

<p>The clapboards must be held down by means of "weight-poles"
laid across, and to keep the weight-poles from rolling
off use pegs called "knees."</p>

<p>Make the knee-pegs of corn-stalk. Cut a hole near both
ends of four of the clapboards and glue in pegs, slanting
them upward. You will then have two pegged clapboards
for the front of the roof and two for the back. Place them
near the ends of the roof and glue all the clapboards in
place. Cut four slender lengths of corn-stalk for weight-poles,
and lay them across the roof, resting against the
knee-pegs. Glue them to the roof only where they buck
the knee-pegs. When finished, set the house aside until

<p>Corn-tassels standing in empty spools make fine trees.</p>

<p>It is fitting that the story of our country's first Thanksgiving
should be retold this year by means of corn. You
remember, of course, that friendly Indians showed the
pioneers how to plant and cultivate corn, which, to them,
was a new grain. Later, when a wonderful harvest had
been gathered, our forefathers decided to set aside a day
to thank God for His goodness. That was the first Thanksgiving.</p>

<small>THE FUNNY ORANGE HEAD</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">You</span> will hardly believe it is only an ordinary, everyday
orange when you have made it into the head that I
am going to tell you about.</p>

<p>Select a small, firm, perfect orange and with a pencil
mark features on it, first the eyes like <a href="#Fig_199">Fig. 199</a>. Carefully
cut out the little spaces of skin between the lines,
then mark the nose (<a href="#Fig_200">Fig. 200</a>); cut this and mark the mouth
(<a href="#Fig_201">Fig. 201</a>); cut this and at each side of the head draw the
ears like <a href="#Fig_202">Fig. 202</a>. You will see that the line of the ear
does not continue all the way around; that means that
you are simply to run your knife along the line, cutting
through the skin so that the ears may be lifted up and
peeled forward to stand out from the head; the front part
remains attached (<a href="#Fig_203">Fig. 203</a>).</p>

<p>Make the neck of a slender, strong, round stick sharpened
to a point at one end. Push the point up into the
under part of the orange, where the neck should be, by
twisting the stick around as it goes in (<a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>).</p>

<p>The orange is the head, but your hand and fingers are
to be the body and arms to go with it. Look at <a href="#Fig_204">Fig. 204</a>.
That will show you how to hold the stick firmly and at
the same time leave your first finger and thumb free to
use as arms.</p>

<p>Pin a handkerchief, or other soft cloth, around Mr.
Orange's neck, bring it around to cover your hand and
then pretend he is talking while you move his arms and
say as many funny things as you can think of. By moving
the stick while you hold it in your hand, you can make the
orange head turn in various ways (<a href="#Fig_205">Figs. 205</a> and <a href="#Fig_206">206</a>), and
a little paper hat fitted on it will make it still funnier (<a href="#Fig_207">Fig.

<p>The orange need not always be a man. You can play

for her small head; or pretend it is a baby and have it
wear a baby's cap made of paper. If you want to turn it
into a young lady, pierce the ears and fit in earrings made
of violets. You do this simply by threading the flower-stems
through the holes you have pierced, and drawing
the blossoms up close to them. Then, you can make believe
the orange is an old man and put a pipe in his mouth.
Make the pipe of an acorn with a twig for the stem. If
you want the baby to cry, squeeze the orange a little and
tears of orange-juice will roll from its eyes and stream
down its face. Little holes must first be punctured in the
eyes to let the tears run out.</p>

<h3>Things You Can Make of Orange-Skins</h3>

<h4>A TOY JAPANESE STOOL</h4>

<p>The soft, golden orange-skin, lined with silvery white,
is fine material for moulding and making into different
kinds of things to play with. Bring your orange and we
will begin by making a toy stool for your doll-house (<a href="#Fig_208">Fig.
208</a>). It will look very much like the real stools which
the Japanese make for real people to sit on, though nothing
is used for it but the orange-skin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 346px;">
<a id="Fig_206"></a>
<img src="images/i_177.png" width="346" height="551" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.206 - "Can't remember what I was
going to say."</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>First cut the orange across from side to side, making
two halves, and after you have taken out the pieces of
juicy fruit and enjoyed eating them, examine the two pretty
yellow orange-skin bowls that are left. See how soft and
pliable they are. Now take one of the bowls and pinch
the edges of two opposite
sides toward each other;
hold them steady while,
with your other hand, you
pinch the other two sides
toward each other. Hold
all four sides bent inward
for a moment, then let go
of them and the sides will
stay bent while you wind
string across, first one way
then the other, between the
curved stool legs you have
just made by bending
the sides of the bowl
inward.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.207 - "What a joke."</div>
</div>



<p>Set the stool away
to dry and stiffen into
shape; then, when it has become hard, take off the string
and you will have a little Japanese stool quite as strong
as if made of wood.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 336px;"><a id="Fig_208"></a>

Orange peel.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h4>A CANDY-BOX</h4>

<p>A candy-box can be made in the same way of the other
half of the orange-skin, but you must curve the sides in
only a little for this; not nearly as much as for the stool.
Stand the candy-box,
with open part
up, ready to be
filled with candy.</p>


<h4>A BASKET</h4>

<p>An orange-skin
basket is a substantial
little affair
when finished, and
will hold almost
anything you want
to put in it. It
looks like <a href="#Fig_209">Fig. 209</a>.
For this you will
again need half of
an orange-skin.
Bend in two opposite
sides after first
cutting a short slit in each side near the edge. Make
the handle of strong paper, cutting it like <a href="#Fig_210">Fig. 210</a>, with a
tongue at each end. Bend over the two side points of each
tongue, and slide one tongue through the slit in one side
of the basket, the other tongue through the slit in the
other side, then open out the points again and they will
make secure fastenings for the handle. You will see from
the illustration that the tongues are put through the basket
from the inside and show on the outside.</p>

<p>Before setting away to dry, tie a string around the bent-in
sides of the basket, and stuff the open part with crushed
paper to keep it in shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>


<h4>ORANGE-SKIN BOWLS</h4>

<p>When you have another orange save the two halves of
the skin, pack each full of crumpled, clean, blank paper,
flatten the bottom of the bowls so that they will stand
firmly, then set them
away to dry.</p>

<p>If you do all this
carefully the bowls will
harden in good shape
and you can use them
to eat and to drink
from.</p>

</div>


<h3>Other Things Made of
Orange-Skins</h3>

<p>Cunning little toy
summer-houses may be
made from an orange-skin
in a moment's
time (<a href="#Fig_211">Fig. 211</a>). Take
half of an orange-skin
and stick the sharp
ends of four wooden
toothpicks into the
edge of its rim. Place the toothpicks upright, at equal
distances apart, and they will form the pillars to support
the golden, dome-shaped roof. Stand the little summer-house
on the table, and you will think it charming.</p>

<p>By slicing an orange you can have a number of little,
yellow hoops for your dolls, made of the rind around each
slice. When the hoops are carefully dried in perfect circles,
you can roll them on top of a table or on the floor, and
play the dolls are having great fun racing with their orange-skin
hoops.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<small>APPLES AND APPLE FUN</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the apple-trees are in bloom, stand under one
and look up through the wonderful tent of flowers at the
little bits of blue sky peeping down at you between the
blossoms. Isn't it delightful to see so many, many apple-blossoms
all at once? How beautiful they are and how
sweet they smell!</p>

<p>Now, pick one little blossom and examine it carefully.
Count the pretty pink-and-white petals. Five petals?
Yes. Look again, see how they grow from the centre and
notice their shape. Be very particular, so that you will
remember exactly how the blossom looks; make sure you
know, for I am going to tell you about the flower you can
find inside the big, ripe apple after all the other apple-blossoms
are gone.</p>


<h3>Apple-Blossom in Apple</h3>

<p>Cut the apple into thin slices from side to side through
the core. Take one of the slices from near the middle of
the apple and hold it up to the light, so that the light will
shine through it, then look carefully and you will see in
the centre a perfect pattern of the apple-blossom you
gathered from the tree (<a href="#Fig_212">Fig. 212</a>). Apple-seeds form the
centre of the flower. The petals, five in number, are of
the flesh of the fruit. They are of the same shape and
size as the real blossom.   Isn't it wonderful?</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.214 - Design pierced through apple

</div></td></tr>
</table></div>






<p>Now, take the seeds from their hard, glossy cases, again
hold the slice up to the light and lo, in the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a><br /><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
slice, you will find a five-pointed star which twinkles as the
light shines through.</p>

<p>You can add to this and make a pretty, shining pattern
in this way: Take a wooden toothpick, and with its pointed
end pierce little holes all along the edge of the flower
pattern; then make a loop of little holes above one of the
petals (Q, <a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a>), and still another above that one
(R, <a href="#Fig_213">Fig. 213</a>). Pierce the edges of all the petals and make
the same kind of double loops above them also, then the
design will be like <a href="#Fig_214">Fig. 214</a>. Hold it up to the light, turn
it this way and that and your slice of apple will look as if
spangled with glittering diamonds. <a href="#Fig_215">Fig. 215</a> shows a wheel
design which you can make of another slice.</p>

<h3>Apple Candle in its Candlestick</h3>

<img src="images/i_184a.png" width="376" height="339" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.216 - Apple candle ready for table.</div>
</div>



<p>When I was a little girl I used to make apple candles
that stood up in their own candlesticks. I always ate the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
fresh, juicy slices as I cut them off. <a href="#Fig_216">Fig. 216</a> shows how
the candles look when finished. The stem is the wick,
and as it is usually dark at the end, it is a very good imitation
of a candlewick
that is partially
burnt. The
dotted lines on <a href="#Fig_217">Fig.
217</a> show how to
cut away the apple
to leave the candle
and its holder.</p>



<p>First cut off a
slice at the blossom
end, so that
the candle-stick
will stand without tipping.
The dotted line
at the bottom of <a href="#Fig_217">Fig.
217</a> indicates where
this cut is to be made.
Then run your knife
around the apple without
cutting all the way
through to the core,
where you see the middle
dotted line on <a href="#Fig_217">Fig.
217</a>. After that, begin
at the sides and gradually
shave down the upper part little by little, being
careful not to cut below the slit you have made around
the apple. When the middle part standing up around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
core is the size of a real candle it is time to stop cutting.
Because of the core inside you cannot make your candle
very slender, but you can
cut off the sharp edges
and make it round.</p>

<div class="caption">Fig.217 - Cut away apple leaving candle
in candle-stick.</div>
</div>

<h3>A Roasted Apple</h3>

<p>Another thing I used to
love to do with my apple
when I was a little girl
was to tie a long string
to the stem and hang it
before an open fire to
roast. I think you will
enjoy it too.</p>

<p>Tie one end of the
string securely to the
stem of your apple, and
don't break the stem off
in doing it (<a href="#Fig_218">Fig. 218</a>);
then tie the other end to
something heavy on the
mantel-shelf that will
hold it securely. The apple
should hang in front
of a grate of glowing
coals, or near the red-hot
coals of a wood-fire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 298px;">
<a id="Fig_218"></a>
<img src="images/i_185.png" width="298" height="646" alt="drawings" />
<div class="caption">Fig.218 - Roast your apple this way.</div>
</div>
<p>As soon as cooking begins, twist the string and make
the apple spin round and round so that it may be roasted
evenly on all sides; it is fun to do that. When the juice
begins to run and drop from the apple, set a saucer under
to catch the hot, sweet syrup. It is good poured over the
apple when that is thoroughly cooked. Add sugar to the
juice while it is hot if it is not sweet enough.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Spice Apple</h3>

<p>In New England, many years ago, there was always
to be found in every household at least one spice apple.
It sounds good to eat, doesn't it? But they were not made
for eating, they were used for sweet-smelling ornaments,
and for keeping away moths and other troublesome insects.
Perhaps you will like to make a spice apple to give
away; it will be a pretty and very sweet gift and will last
for years.</p>

<p>Choose a small, perfectly sound apple and have ready
a lot of cloves. Stick the cloves into the apple as you would
stick pins into a cushion, only the cloves must be put in
very close together, touching each other and making the
apple look like a large, prickly, brown nut. That is all,
unless you want to hang the apple up. In that case run
a wooden toothpick through one raised side at the top,
across the little hollow where the stem grows, and out
through the raised side opposite, after first breaking off the
stem. Cross this toothpick with another pushed through
the apple and also bridging the hollow. This will make
a low handle in the form of a cross. At the middle, where
the toothpicks touch, tie a bright ribbon, leaving a loop
by which to hang it.</p>


<h3>Other Things to Make of an Apple</h3>

<p>When an apple is cut across into round slices, you can
make a doll's table of the largest slice by using four wooden
toothpicks for legs, pushing them into the apple at equal
distances apart. Half of a slice, with halves of toothpicks
for legs, makes a very suitable seat for this remarkable
table.</p>

<p>If you cut a thick flat slice from a small apple you can
make it into a top that will spin by pushing a toothpick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
through the centre, leaving a long end on one side and a
shorter end on the other. The short end is the peg upon
which the top spins. Take the long, upper end of the
toothpick between your thumb and first finger, give it
a hard, quick twist and drop the top on a table having a
hard, smooth finish, where it will spin merrily. The little
fruit-top will not spin on a carpet or any rough, uneven
surface.</p>
